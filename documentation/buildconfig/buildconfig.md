## Chapter 1. Understanding image builds

### 1.1. Builds

A build is the process of transforming input parameters into a resulting object. Most often, the process is used to transform input parameters or source code into a runnable image. A `BuildConfig` object is the definition of the entire build process.


OpenShift Container Platform uses Kubernetes by creating containers from build images and pushing them to a container image registry.


Build objects share common characteristics including inputs for a build, the requirement to complete a build process, logging the build process, publishing resources from successful builds, and publishing the final status of the build. Builds take advantage of resource restrictions, specifying limitations on resources such as CPU usage, memory usage, and build or pod execution time.


The OpenShift Container Platform build system provides extensible support for build strategies that are based on selectable types specified in the build API. There are three primary build strategies available:


- Docker build

- Source-to-image (S2I) build

- Custom build


By default, docker builds and S2I builds are supported.


The resulting object of a build depends on the builder used to create it. For docker and S2I builds, the resulting objects are runnable images. For custom builds, the resulting objects are whatever the builder image author has specified.


Additionally, the pipeline build strategy can be used to implement sophisticated workflows:


- Continuous integration

- Continuous deployment


#### 1.1.1. Docker build

OpenShift Container Platform uses Buildah to build a container image from a Dockerfile. For more information on building container images with Dockerfiles, see [the Dockerfile reference documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).


Tip

If you set Docker build arguments by using the `buildArgs` array, see [Understand how ARG and FROM interact](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#understand-how-arg-and-from-interact) in the Dockerfile reference documentation.


#### 1.1.2. Source-to-image build

Source-to-image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible container images. It produces ready-to-run images by injecting application source into a container image and assembling a new image. The new image incorporates the base image, the builder, and built source and is ready to use with the `buildah run` command. S2I supports incremental builds, which re-use previously downloaded dependencies, previously built artifacts, and so on.


#### 1.1.3. Custom build

The custom build strategy allows developers to define a specific builder image responsible for the entire build process. Using your own builder image allows you to customize your build process.


A custom builder image is a plain container image embedded with build process logic, for example for building RPMs or base images.


Custom builds run with a high level of privilege and are not available to users by default. Only users who can be trusted with cluster administration permissions should be granted access to run custom builds.


#### 1.1.4. Pipeline build

Important

The Pipeline build strategy is deprecated in OpenShift Container Platform 4. Equivalent and improved functionality is present in the OpenShift Container Platform Pipelines based on Tekton.


Jenkins images on OpenShift Container Platform are fully supported and users should follow Jenkins user documentation for defining their `jenkinsfile` in a job or store it in a Source Control Management system.


The Pipeline build strategy allows developers to define a Jenkins pipeline for use by the Jenkins pipeline plugin. The build can be started, monitored, and managed by OpenShift Container Platform in the same way as any other build type.


Pipeline workflows are defined in a `jenkinsfile`, either embedded directly in the build configuration, or supplied in a Git repository and referenced by the build configuration.


## Chapter 2. Understanding build configurations

The following sections define the concept of a build, build configuration, and outline the primary build strategies available.


### 2.1. BuildConfigs

A build configuration describes a single build definition and a set of triggers for when a new build is created. Build configurations are defined by a `BuildConfig`, which is a REST object that can be used in a POST to the API server to create a new instance.


A build configuration, or `BuildConfig`, is characterized by a build strategy and one or more sources. The strategy determines the process, while the sources provide its input.


Depending on how you choose to create your application using OpenShift Container Platform, a `BuildConfig` is typically generated automatically for you if you use the web console or CLI, and it can be edited at any time. Understanding the parts that make up a `BuildConfig` and their available options can help if you choose to manually change your configuration later.


The following example `BuildConfig` results in a new build every time a container image tag or the source code changes:

[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO1-1)

This specification creates a new `BuildConfig` named `ruby-sample-build`.


[2](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO1-2)

The `runPolicy` field controls whether builds created from this build configuration can be run simultaneously. The default value is `Serial`, which means new builds run sequentially, not simultaneously.


[3](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO1-3)

You can specify a list of triggers, which cause a new build to be created.


[4](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO1-4)

The `source` section defines the source of the build. The source type determines the primary source of input, and can be either `Git`, to point to a code repository location, `Dockerfile`, to build from an inline Dockerfile, or `Binary`, to accept binary payloads. It is possible to have multiple sources at once. See the documentation for each source type for details.


[5](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO1-5)

The `strategy` section describes the build strategy used to execute the build. You can specify a `Source` , `Docker`, or `Custom` strategy here. This example uses the `ruby-20-centos7` container image that Source-to-image (S2I) uses for the application build.


[6](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO1-6)

After the container image is successfully built, it is pushed into the repository described in the `output` section.


[7](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO1-7)

The `postCommit` section defines an optional build hook.


## Chapter 3. Creating build inputs

Use the following sections for an overview of build inputs, instructions on how to use inputs to provide source content for builds to operate on, and how to use build environments and create secrets.


### 3.1. Build inputs

A build input provides source content for builds to operate on. You can use the following build inputs to provide sources in OpenShift Container Platform, listed in order of precedence:


- Inline Dockerfile definitions

- Content extracted from existing images

- Git repositories

- Binary (Local) inputs

- Input secrets

- External artifacts


You can combine multiple inputs in a single build. However, as the inline Dockerfile takes precedence, it can overwrite any other file named Dockerfile provided by another input. Binary (local) input and Git repositories are mutually exclusive inputs.


You can use input secrets when you do not want certain resources or credentials used during a build to be available in the final application image produced by the build, or want to consume a value that is defined in a secret resource. External artifacts can be used to pull in additional files that are not available as one of the other build input types.


When you run a build:


1. A working directory is constructed and all input content is placed in the working directory. For example, the input Git repository is cloned into the working directory, and files specified from input images are copied into the working directory using the target path.

2. The build process changes directories into the `contextDir`, if one is defined.

3. The inline Dockerfile, if any, is written to the current directory.

4. The content from the current directory is provided to the build process for reference by the Dockerfile, custom builder logic, or `assemble` script. This means any input content that resides outside the `contextDir` is ignored by the build.


The following example of a source definition includes multiple input types and an explanation of how they are combined. For more details on how each input type is defined, see the specific sections for each input type.

```

[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO2-1)

The repository to be cloned into the working directory for the build.


[2](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO2-2)

`/usr/lib/somefile.jar` from `myinputimage` is stored in `<workingdir>/app/dir/injected/dir`.


[3](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO2-3)

The working directory for the build becomes `<original_workingdir>/app/dir`.


[4](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO2-4)

A Dockerfile with this content is created in `<original_workingdir>/app/dir`, overwriting any existing file with that name.


### 3.2. Dockerfile source

When you supply a `dockerfile` value, the content of this field is written to disk as a file named `dockerfile`. This is done after other input sources are processed, so if the input source repository contains a Dockerfile in the root directory, it is overwritten with this content.


The source definition is part of the `spec` section in the `BuildConfig`:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
source:
  dockerfile: "FROM centos:7\nRUN yum install -y httpd"
```

```yaml
source:
  dockerfile: "FROM centos:7\nRUN yum install -y httpd"
```

1

```yaml

```

[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO3-1)

The `dockerfile` field contains an inline Dockerfile that is built.


**Additional resources**

- The typical use for this field is to provide a Dockerfile to a docker strategy build.


### 3.3. Image source

You can add additional files to the build process with images. Input images are referenced in the same way the `From` and `To` image targets are defined. This means both container images and image stream tags can be referenced. In conjunction with the image, you must provide one or more path pairs to indicate the path of the files or directories to copy the image and the destination to place them in the build context.


The source path can be any absolute path within the image specified. The destination must be a relative directory path. At build time, the image is loaded and the indicated files and directories are copied into the context directory of the build process. This is the same directory into which the source repository content is cloned. If the source path ends in `/.` then the content of the directory is copied, but the directory itself is not created at the destination.


Image inputs are specified in the `source` definition of the `BuildConfig`:

```

[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO4-1)

An array of one or more input images and files.


[2](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO4-2)

A reference to the image containing the files to be copied.


[3](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO4-3)

An array of source/destination paths.


[4](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO4-4)

The directory relative to the build root where the build process can access the file.


[5](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO4-5)

The location of the file to be copied out of the referenced image.


[6](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO4-6)

An optional secret provided if credentials are needed to access the input image.


Note

If your cluster uses an `ImageDigestMirrorSet`, `ImageTagMirrorSet`, or `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object to configure repository mirroring, you can use only global pull secrets for mirrored registries. You cannot add a pull secret to a project.


**Images that require pull secrets**

When using an input image that requires a pull secret, you can link the pull secret to the service account used by the build. By default, builds use the `builder` service account. The pull secret is automatically added to the build if the secret contains a credential that matches the repository hosting the input image. To link a pull secret to the service account used by the build, run:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc secrets link builder dockerhub
```

```shell-session
$ oc secrets link builder dockerhub
```

Note

This feature is not supported for builds using the custom strategy.


**Images on mirrored registries that require pull secrets**

When using an input image from a mirrored registry, if you get a `build error: failed to pull image` message, you can resolve the error by using either of the following methods:


- Create an input secret that contains the authentication credentials for the builder image’s repository and all known mirrors. In this case, create a pull secret for credentials to the image registry and its mirrors.

- Use the input secret as the pull secret on the `BuildConfig` object.


### 3.4. Git source

When specified, source code is fetched from the supplied location.


If you supply an inline Dockerfile, it overwrites the Dockerfile in the `contextDir` of the Git repository.


The source definition is part of the `spec` section in the `BuildConfig`:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
source:
  git:
    uri: "https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world"
    ref: "master"
  contextDir: "app/dir"
  dockerfile: "FROM openshift/ruby-22-centos7\nUSER example"
```

```yaml
source:
  git:
```

1

```yaml

    uri: "https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world"
    ref: "master"
  contextDir: "app/dir"
```

2

```yaml

  dockerfile: "FROM openshift/ruby-22-centos7\nUSER example"
```

3

```yaml

```

[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO5-1)

The `git` field contains the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to the remote Git repository of the source code. You must specify the value of the `ref` field to check out a specific Git reference. A valid `ref` can be a SHA1 tag or a branch name. The default value of the `ref` field is `master`.


[2](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO5-2)

The `contextDir` field allows you to override the default location inside the source code repository where the build looks for the application source code. If your application exists inside a sub-directory, you can override the default location (the root folder) using this field.


[3](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO5-3)

If the optional `dockerfile` field is provided, it should be a string containing a Dockerfile that overwrites any Dockerfile that may exist in the source repository.


If the `ref` field denotes a pull request, the system uses a `git fetch` operation and then checkout `FETCH_HEAD`.


When no `ref` value is provided, OpenShift Container Platform performs a shallow clone ( `--depth=1`). In this case, only the files associated with the most recent commit on the default branch (typically `master`) are downloaded. This results in repositories downloading faster, but without the full commit history. To perform a full `git clone` of the default branch of a specified repository, set `ref` to the name of the default branch (for example `main`).


Warning

Git clone operations that go through a proxy that is performing man in the middle (MITM) TLS hijacking or reencrypting of the proxied connection do not work.


#### 3.4.1. Using a proxy

If your Git repository can only be accessed using a proxy, you can define the proxy to use in the `source` section of the build configuration. You can configure both an HTTP and HTTPS proxy to use. Both fields are optional. Domains for which no proxying should be performed can also be specified in the `NoProxy` field.


Note

Your source URI must use the HTTP or HTTPS protocol for this to work.


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
source:
  git:
    uri: "https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world"
    ref: "master"
    httpProxy: http://proxy.example.com
    httpsProxy: https://proxy.example.com
    noProxy: somedomain.com, otherdomain.com
```

```yaml
source:
  git:
    uri: "https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world"
    ref: "master"
    httpProxy: http://proxy.example.com
    httpsProxy: https://proxy.example.com
    noProxy: somedomain.com, otherdomain.com
```

Note

For Pipeline strategy builds, given the current restrictions with the Git plugin for Jenkins, any Git operations through the Git plugin do not leverage the HTTP or HTTPS proxy defined in the `BuildConfig`. The Git plugin only uses the proxy configured in the Jenkins UI at the Plugin Manager panel. This proxy is then used for all git interactions within Jenkins, across all jobs.


**Additional resources**

- You can find instructions on how to configure proxies through the Jenkins UI at [JenkinsBehindProxy](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JenkinsBehindProxy).


#### 3.4.2. Source Clone Secrets

Builder pods require access to any Git repositories defined as source for a build. Source clone secrets are used to provide the builder pod with access it would not normally have access to, such as private repositories or repositories with self-signed or untrusted SSL certificates.


The following source clone secret configurations are supported:


- A `.gitconfig` file

- Basic authentication

- SSH key authentication

- Trusted certificate authorities


Note

You can also use combinations of these configurations to meet your specific needs.


##### 3.4.2.1. Automatically adding a source clone secret to a build configuration

When a `BuildConfig` is created, OpenShift Container Platform can automatically populate its source clone secret reference. This behavior allows the resulting builds to automatically use the credentials stored in the referenced secret to authenticate to a remote Git repository, without requiring further configuration.


To use this functionality, a secret containing the Git repository credentials must exist in the namespace in which the `BuildConfig` is later created. This secrets must include one or more annotations prefixed with `build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-`. The value of each of these annotations is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) pattern, which is defined as follows. When a `BuildConfig` is created without a source clone secret reference and its Git source URI matches a URI pattern in a secret annotation, OpenShift Container Platform automatically inserts a reference to that secret in the `BuildConfig`.


**Prerequisites**

A URI pattern must consist of:


- A valid scheme: `*://`, `git://`, `http://`, `https://` or `ssh://`
- A host: \*\` or a valid hostname or IP address optionally preceded by `*.`
- A path: `/*` or `/` followed by any characters optionally including `*` characters


In all of the above, a `*` character is interpreted as a wildcard.


Important

URI patterns must match Git source URIs which are conformant to [RFC3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt). Do not include a username (or password) component in a URI pattern.


For example, if you use `ssh://git@bitbucket.atlassian.com:7999/ATLASSIAN jira.git` for a git repository URL, the source secret must be specified as `ssh://bitbucket.atlassian.com:7999/*` (and not `ssh://git@bitbucket.atlassian.com:7999/*`).


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc annotate secret mysecret \
    'build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-1=ssh://bitbucket.atlassian.com:7999/*'
```

```shell-session
$ oc annotate secret mysecret \
    'build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-1=ssh://bitbucket.atlassian.com:7999/*'
```

**Procedure**

If multiple secrets match the Git URI of a particular `BuildConfig`, OpenShift Container Platform selects the secret with the longest match. This allows for basic overriding, as in the following example.


The following fragment shows two partial source clone secrets, the first matching any server in the domain `mycorp.com` accessed by HTTPS, and the second overriding access to servers `mydev1.mycorp.com` and `mydev2.mycorp.com`:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: matches-all-corporate-servers-https-only
  annotations:
    build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-1: https://*.mycorp.com/*
data:
  ...
---
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: override-for-my-dev-servers-https-only
  annotations:
    build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-1: https://mydev1.mycorp.com/*
    build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-2: https://mydev2.mycorp.com/*
data:
  ...
```

```yaml
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: matches-all-corporate-servers-https-only
  annotations:
    build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-1: https://*.mycorp.com/*
data:
  ...
---
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: override-for-my-dev-servers-https-only
  annotations:
    build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-1: https://mydev1.mycorp.com/*
    build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-2: https://mydev2.mycorp.com/*
data:
  ...
```

- Add a `build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-` annotation to a pre-existing secret using:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc annotate secret mysecret \
      'build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-1=https://*.mycorp.com/*'
```



```shell-session
$ oc annotate secret mysecret \
      'build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-1=https://*.mycorp.com/*'
```


##### 3.4.2.2. Manually adding a source clone secret

Source clone secrets can be added manually to a build configuration by adding a `sourceSecret` field to the `source` section inside the `BuildConfig` and setting it to the name of the secret that you created. In this example, it is the `basicsecret`.


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
apiVersion: "build.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "BuildConfig"
metadata:
  name: "sample-build"
spec:
  output:
    to:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "sample-image:latest"
  source:
    git:
      uri: "https://github.com/user/app.git"
    sourceSecret:
      name: "basicsecret"
  strategy:
    sourceStrategy:

oc set build-secret --source bc/sample-build basicsecret
```



```shell-session
$ oc set build-secret --source bc/sample-build basicsecret
```


##### 3.4.2.3. Creating a secret from a .gitconfig file

If the cloning of your application is dependent on a `.gitconfig` file, then you can create a secret that contains it. Add it to the builder service account and then your `BuildConfig`.


**Procedure**

- To create a secret from a `.gitconfig` file:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc create secret generic <secret_name> --from-file=<path/to/.gitconfig>
```

```shell-session
$ oc create secret generic <secret_name> --from-file=<path/to/.gitconfig>
```

Note

SSL verification can be turned off if `sslVerify=false` is set for the `http` section in your `.gitconfig` file:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
[http]
        sslVerify=false
```

```plaintext
[http]
        sslVerify=false
```

##### 3.4.2.4. Creating a secret from a .gitconfig file for secured Git

If your Git server is secured with two-way SSL and user name with password, you must add the certificate files to your source build and add references to the certificate files in the `.gitconfig` file.


**Prerequisites**

- You must have Git credentials.


**Procedure**

Add the certificate files to your source build and add references to the certificate files in the `.gitconfig` file.


1. Add the `client.crt`, `cacert.crt`, and `client.key` files to the `/var/run/secrets/openshift.io/source/` folder in the application source code.

2. In the `.gitconfig` file for the server, add the `[http]` section shown in the following example:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
cat .gitconfig
```



```shell-session
# cat .gitconfig
```




**Example output**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
[user]
           name = <name>
           email = <email>
[http]
           sslVerify = false
           sslCert = /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/source/client.crt
           sslKey = /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/source/client.key
           sslCaInfo = /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/source/cacert.crt
```



```shell-session
[user]
           name = <name>
           email = <email>
[http]
           sslVerify = false
           sslCert = /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/source/client.crt
           sslKey = /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/source/client.key
           sslCaInfo = /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/source/cacert.crt
```

3. Create the secret:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```


[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO6-1)


The user’s Git user name.


[2](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO6-2)


The password for this user.



Important

To avoid having to enter your password again, be sure to specify the source-to-image (S2I) image in your builds. However, if you cannot clone the repository, you must still specify your user name and password to promote the build.


**Additional resources**

- `/var/run/secrets/openshift.io/source/` folder in the application source code.


##### 3.4.2.5. Creating a secret from source code basic authentication

Basic authentication requires either a combination of `--username` and `--password`, or a token to authenticate against the software configuration management (SCM) server.


**Prerequisites**

- User name and password to access the private repository.


**Procedure**

1. Create the secret first before using the `--username` and `--password` to access the private repository:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
       --from-literal=username=<user_name> \
       --from-literal=password=<password> \
       --type=kubernetes.io/basic-auth
```



```shell-session
$ oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
       --from-literal=username=<user_name> \
       --from-literal=password=<password> \
       --type=kubernetes.io/basic-auth
```

2. Create a basic authentication secret with a token:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
       --from-literal=password=<token> \
       --type=kubernetes.io/basic-auth
```



```shell-session
$ oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
       --from-literal=password=<token> \
       --type=kubernetes.io/basic-auth
```


##### 3.4.2.6. Creating a secret from source code SSH key authentication

SSH key based authentication requires a private SSH key.


The repository keys are usually located in the `$HOME/.ssh/` directory, and are named `id_dsa.pub`, `id_ecdsa.pub`, `id_ed25519.pub`, or `id_rsa.pub` by default.


**Procedure**

1. Generate SSH key credentials:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```



```shell-session
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```



Note






Creating a passphrase for the SSH key prevents OpenShift Container Platform from building. When prompted for a passphrase, leave it blank.






    Two files are created: the public key and a corresponding private key (one of `id_dsa`, `id_ecdsa`, `id_ed25519`, or `id_rsa`). With both of these in place, consult your source control management (SCM) system’s manual on how to upload the public key. The private key is used to access your private repository.


2. Before using the SSH key to access the private repository, create the secret:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
       --from-file=ssh-privatekey=<path/to/ssh/private/key> \
       --from-file=<path/to/known_hosts> \
       --type=kubernetes.io/ssh-auth
```



```shell-session
$ oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
       --from-file=ssh-privatekey=<path/to/ssh/private/key> \
       --from-file=<path/to/known_hosts> \
```

1

```shell-session

       --type=kubernetes.io/ssh-auth
```


[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO7-1)


Optional: Adding this field enables strict server host key check.





Warning






Skipping the `known_hosts` file while creating the secret makes the build vulnerable to a potential man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.






Note






Ensure that the `known_hosts` file includes an entry for the host of your source code.



##### 3.4.2.7. Creating a secret from source code trusted certificate authorities

The set of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate authorities (CA) that are trusted during a Git clone operation are built into the OpenShift Container Platform infrastructure images. If your Git server uses a self-signed certificate or one signed by an authority not trusted by the image, you can create a secret that contains the certificate or disable TLS verification.


If you create a secret for the CA certificate, OpenShift Container Platform uses it to access your Git server during the Git clone operation. Using this method is significantly more secure than disabling Git SSL verification, which accepts any TLS certificate that is presented.


**Procedure**

Create a secret with a CA certificate file.


1. If your CA uses Intermediate Certificate Authorities, combine the certificates for all CAs in a `ca.crt` file. Enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
cat intermediateCA.crt intermediateCA.crt rootCA.crt > ca.crt
```



```shell-session
$ cat intermediateCA.crt intermediateCA.crt rootCA.crt > ca.crt
```

2. Create the secret by entering the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc create secret generic mycert --from-file=ca.crt=</path/to/file>
```



```shell-session
$ oc create secret generic mycert --from-file=ca.crt=</path/to/file>
```

1

```shell-session

```


[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO8-1)


You must use the key name `ca.crt`.

### 3.5. Binary (local) source

Streaming content from a local file system to the builder is called a `Binary` type build. The corresponding value of `BuildConfig.spec.source.type` is `Binary` for these builds.


This source type is unique in that it is leveraged solely based on your use of the `oc start-build`.


Note

Binary type builds require content to be streamed from the local file system, so automatically triggering a binary type build, like an image change trigger, is not possible. This is because the binary files cannot be provided. Similarly, you cannot launch binary type builds from the web console.


To utilize binary builds, invoke `oc start-build` with one of these options:


- `--from-file`: The contents of the file you specify are sent as a binary stream to the builder. You can also specify a URL to a file. Then, the builder stores the data in a file with the same name at the top of the build context.

- `--from-dir` and `--from-repo`: The contents are archived and sent as a binary stream to the builder. Then, the builder extracts the contents of the archive within the build context directory. With `--from-dir`, you can also specify a URL to an archive, which is extracted.

- `--from-archive`: The archive you specify is sent to the builder, where it is extracted within the build context directory. This option behaves the same as `--from-dir`; an archive is created on your host first, whenever the argument to these options is a directory.


In each of the previously listed cases:


- If your `BuildConfig` already has a `Binary` source type defined, it is effectively ignored and replaced by what the client sends.

- If your `BuildConfig` has a `Git` source type defined, it is dynamically disabled, since `Binary` and `Git` are mutually exclusive, and the data in the binary stream provided to the builder takes precedence.


Instead of a file name, you can pass a URL with HTTP or HTTPS schema to `--from-file` and `--from-archive`. When using `--from-file` with a URL, the name of the file in the builder image is determined by the `Content-Disposition` header sent by the web server, or the last component of the URL path if the header is not present. No form of authentication is supported and it is not possible to use custom TLS certificate or disable certificate validation.


When using `oc new-build --binary=true`, the command ensures that the restrictions associated with binary builds are enforced. The resulting `BuildConfig` has a source type of `Binary`, meaning that the only valid way to run a build for this `BuildConfig` is to use `oc start-build` with one of the `--from` options to provide the requisite binary data.


The Dockerfile and `contextDir` source options have special meaning with binary builds.


Dockerfile can be used with any binary build source. If Dockerfile is used and the binary stream is an archive, its contents serve as a replacement Dockerfile to any Dockerfile in the archive. If Dockerfile is used with the `--from-file` argument, and the file argument is named Dockerfile, the value from Dockerfile replaces the value from the binary stream.


In the case of the binary stream encapsulating extracted archive content, the value of the `contextDir` field is interpreted as a subdirectory within the archive, and, if valid, the builder changes into that subdirectory before executing the build.


### 3.6. Input secrets and config maps

Important

To prevent the contents of input secrets and config maps from appearing in build output container images, use build volumes in your [Docker build](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#builds-using-build-volumes_build-strategies-docker "5.1.6. Using build volumes") and [source-to-image build](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#builds-using-build-volumes_build-strategies-s2i "5.2.6. Using build volumes") strategies.


In some scenarios, build operations require credentials or other configuration data to access dependent resources, but it is undesirable for that information to be placed in source control. You can define input secrets and input config maps for this purpose.


For example, when building a Java application with Maven, you can set up a private mirror of Maven Central or JCenter that is accessed by private keys. To download libraries from that private mirror, you have to supply the following:


1. A `settings.xml` file configured with the mirror’s URL and connection settings.

2. A private key referenced in the settings file, such as `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.


For security reasons, you do not want to expose your credentials in the application image.


This example describes a Java application, but you can use the same approach for adding SSL certificates into the `/etc/ssl/certs` directory, API keys or tokens, license files, and more.


#### 3.6.1. What is a secret?

The `Secret` object type provides a mechanism to hold sensitive information such as passwords, OpenShift Container Platform client configuration files, `dockercfg` files, private source repository credentials, and so on. Secrets decouple sensitive content from the pods. You can mount secrets into containers using a volume plugin or the system can use secrets to perform actions on behalf of a pod.


**YAML Secret Object Definition**

```

5

```yaml

```

[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO9-1)

Indicates the structure of the secret’s key names and values.


[2](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO9-2)

The allowable format for the keys in the `data` field must meet the guidelines in the `DNS_SUBDOMAIN` value in the Kubernetes identifiers glossary.


[3](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO9-3)

The value associated with keys in the `data` map must be base64 encoded.


[4](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO9-4)

Entries in the `stringData` map are converted to base64 and the entry are then moved to the `data` map automatically. This field is write-only. The value is only be returned by the `data` field.


[5](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO9-5)

The value associated with keys in the `stringData` map is made up of plain text strings.


##### 3.6.1.1. Properties of secrets

Key properties include:


- Secret data can be referenced independently from its definition.

- Secret data volumes are backed by temporary file-storage facilities (tmpfs) and never come to rest on a node.

- Secret data can be shared within a namespace.


##### 3.6.1.2. Types of Secrets

The value in the `type` field indicates the structure of the secret’s key names and values. The type can be used to enforce the presence of user names and keys in the secret object. If you do not want validation, use the `opaque` type, which is the default.


Specify one of the following types to trigger minimal server-side validation to ensure the presence of specific key names in the secret data:


- `kubernetes.io/service-account-token`. Uses a service account token.

- `kubernetes.io/dockercfg`. Uses the `.dockercfg` file for required Docker credentials.

- `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`. Uses the `.docker/config.json` file for required Docker credentials.

- `kubernetes.io/basic-auth`. Use with basic authentication.

- `kubernetes.io/ssh-auth`. Use with SSH key authentication.

- `kubernetes.io/tls`. Use with TLS certificate authorities.


Specify `type= Opaque` if you do not want validation, which means the secret does not claim to conform to any convention for key names or values. An `opaque` secret, allows for unstructured `key:value` pairs that can contain arbitrary values.


Note

You can specify other arbitrary types, such as `example.com/my-secret-type`. These types are not enforced server-side, but indicate that the creator of the secret intended to conform to the key/value requirements of that type.


##### 3.6.1.3. Updates to secrets

When you modify the value of a secret, the value used by an already running pod does not dynamically change. To change a secret, you must delete the original pod and create a new pod, in some cases with an identical `PodSpec`.


Updating a secret follows the same workflow as deploying a new container image. You can use the `kubectl rolling-update` command.


The `resourceVersion` value in a secret is not specified when it is referenced. Therefore, if a secret is updated at the same time as pods are starting, the version of the secret that is used for the pod is not defined.


Note

Currently, it is not possible to check the resource version of a secret object that was used when a pod was created. It is planned that pods report this information, so that a controller could restart ones using an old `resourceVersion`. In the interim, do not update the data of existing secrets, but create new ones with distinct names.


#### 3.6.2. Creating secrets

You must create a secret before creating the pods that depend on that secret.


When creating secrets:


- Create a secret object with secret data.

- Update the pod service account to allow the reference to the secret.

- Create a pod, which consumes the secret as an environment variable or as a file using a `secret` volume.


**Procedure**

- To create a secret object from a JSON or YAML file, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc create -f <filename>
```



```shell-session
$ oc create -f <filename>
```



For example, you can create a secret from your local `.docker/config.json` file:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc create secret generic dockerhub \
      --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path/to/.docker/config.json> \
      --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
```



```shell-session
$ oc create secret generic dockerhub \
      --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path/to/.docker/config.json> \
      --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
```



This command generates a JSON specification of the secret named `dockerhub` and creates the object.

#### 3.6.4. Adding input secrets and config maps

To provide credentials and other configuration data to a build without placing them in source control, you can define input secrets and input config maps.


In some scenarios, build operations require credentials or other configuration data to access dependent resources. To make that information available without placing it in source control, you can define input secrets and input config maps.


**Procedure**

To add an input secret, config maps, or both to an existing `BuildConfig` object:


1. If the `ConfigMap` object does not exist, create it by entering the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc create configmap settings-mvn \
       --from-file=settings.xml=<path/to/settings.xml>
```



```shell-session
$ oc create configmap settings-mvn \
       --from-file=settings.xml=<path/to/settings.xml>
```



    This creates a new config map named `settings-mvn`, which contains the plain text content of the `settings.xml` file.



Tip






You can alternatively apply the following YAML to create the config map:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
apiVersion: core/v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
     name: settings-mvn
data:
     settings.xml: |
       <settings>
       … # Insert maven settings here
       </settings>
```



```yaml
apiVersion: core/v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
     name: settings-mvn
data:
     settings.xml: |
       <settings>
       … # Insert maven settings here
       </settings>
```

2. If the `Secret` object does not exist, create it by entering the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc create secret generic secret-mvn \
       --from-file=ssh-privatekey=<path/to/.ssh/id_rsa> \
       --type=kubernetes.io/ssh-auth
```



```shell-session
$ oc create secret generic secret-mvn \
       --from-file=ssh-privatekey=<path/to/.ssh/id_rsa> \
       --type=kubernetes.io/ssh-auth
```



    This creates a new secret named `secret-mvn`, which contains the base64 encoded content of the `id_rsa` private key.



Tip






You can alternatively apply the following YAML to create the input secret:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
apiVersion: core/v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
     name: secret-mvn
type: kubernetes.io/ssh-auth
data:
     ssh-privatekey: |
       # Insert ssh private key, base64 encoded
```



```yaml
apiVersion: core/v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
     name: secret-mvn
type: kubernetes.io/ssh-auth
data:
     ssh-privatekey: |
       # Insert ssh private key, base64 encoded
```

3. Add the config map and secret to the `source` section in the existing `BuildConfig` object:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
source:
     git:
       uri: https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git
     contextDir: helloworld
     configMaps:
    - configMap:
        name: settings-mvn
secrets:
    - secret:
        name: secret-mvn
```

```yaml
source:
git:
    uri: https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git
contextDir: helloworld
configMaps:
    - configMap:
        name: settings-mvn
secrets:
    - secret:
        name: secret-mvn
```

4. To include the secret and config map in a new `BuildConfig` object, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc new-build \
       openshift/wildfly-101-centos7~https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git \
       --context-dir helloworld --build-secret “secret-mvn” \
       --build-config-map "settings-mvn"
```



```shell-session
$ oc new-build \
       openshift/wildfly-101-centos7~https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git \
       --context-dir helloworld --build-secret “secret-mvn” \
       --build-config-map "settings-mvn"
```



    During the build, the build process copies the `settings.xml` and `id_rsa` files into the directory where the source code is located. In OpenShift Container Platform S2I builder images, this is the image working directory, which is set using the `WORKDIR` instruction in the `Dockerfile`. If you want to specify another directory, add a `destinationDir` to the definition:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
source:
     git:
       uri: https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git
     contextDir: helloworld
     configMaps:
    - configMap:
        name: settings-mvn
      destinationDir: ".m2"
secrets:
    - secret:
        name: secret-mvn
      destinationDir: ".ssh"
```

```yaml
source:
git:
    uri: https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git
contextDir: helloworld
configMaps:
    - configMap:
        name: settings-mvn
      destinationDir: ".m2"
secrets:
    - secret:
        name: secret-mvn
      destinationDir: ".ssh"
```

You can also specify the destination directory when creating a new `BuildConfig` object by entering the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc new-build \
    openshift/wildfly-101-centos7~https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git \
    --context-dir helloworld --build-secret “secret-mvn:.ssh” \
    --build-config-map "settings-mvn:.m2"
```

```shell-session
$ oc new-build \
    openshift/wildfly-101-centos7~https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git \
    --context-dir helloworld --build-secret “secret-mvn:.ssh” \
    --build-config-map "settings-mvn:.m2"
```

In both cases, the `settings.xml` file is added to the `./.m2` directory of the build environment, and the `id_rsa` key is added to the `./.ssh` directory.


#### 3.6.5. Source-to-image strategy

When using a `Source` strategy, all defined input secrets are copied to their respective `destinationDir`. If you left `destinationDir` empty, then the secrets are placed in the working directory of the builder image.


The same rule is used when a `destinationDir` is a relative path. The secrets are placed in the paths that are relative to the working directory of the image. The final directory in the `destinationDir` path is created if it does not exist in the builder image. All preceding directories in the `destinationDir` must exist, or an error will occur.


Note

Input secrets are added as world-writable, have `0666` permissions, and are truncated to size zero after executing the `assemble` script. This means that the secret files exist in the resulting image, but they are empty for security reasons.


Input config maps are not truncated after the `assemble` script completes.


#### 3.6.6. Docker strategy

When using a docker strategy, you can add all defined input secrets into your container image using the [`ADD`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#add) and [`COPY` instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy) in your Dockerfile.


If you do not specify the `destinationDir` for a secret, then the files are copied into the same directory in which the Dockerfile is located. If you specify a relative path as `destinationDir`, then the secrets are copied into that directory, relative to your Dockerfile location. This makes the secret files available to the Docker build operation as part of the context directory used during the build.


**Example of a Dockerfile referencing secret and config map data**

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
FROM centos/ruby-22-centos7

USER root
COPY ./secret-dir /secrets
COPY ./config /

# Create a shell script that will output secrets and ConfigMaps when the image is run
RUN echo '#!/bin/sh' > /input_report.sh
RUN echo '(test -f /secrets/secret1 && echo -n "secret1=" && cat /secrets/secret1)' >> /input_report.sh
RUN echo '(test -f /config && echo -n "relative-configMap=" && cat /config)' >> /input_report.sh
RUN chmod 755 /input_report.sh

CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/input_report.sh"]
```

```plaintext
FROM centos/ruby-22-centos7

USER root
COPY ./secret-dir /secrets
COPY ./config /

# Create a shell script that will output secrets and ConfigMaps when the image is run
RUN echo '#!/bin/sh' > /input_report.sh
RUN echo '(test -f /secrets/secret1 && echo -n "secret1=" && cat /secrets/secret1)' >> /input_report.sh
RUN echo '(test -f /config && echo -n "relative-configMap=" && cat /config)' >> /input_report.sh
RUN chmod 755 /input_report.sh

CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/input_report.sh"]
```

Important

Users normally remove their input secrets from the final application image so that the secrets are not present in the container running from that image. However, the secrets still exist in the image itself in the layer where they were added. This removal is part of the Dockerfile itself.


To prevent the contents of input secrets and config maps from appearing in the build output container images and avoid this removal process altogether, [use build volumes](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#builds-using-build-volumes_build-strategies-docker "5.1.6. Using build volumes") in your Docker build strategy instead.


#### 3.6.7. Custom strategy

When using a Custom strategy, all the defined input secrets and config maps are available in the builder container in the `/var/run/secrets/openshift.io/build` directory. The custom build image must use these secrets and config maps appropriately. With the Custom strategy, you can define secrets as described in Custom strategy options.


There is no technical difference between existing strategy secrets and the input secrets. However, your builder image can distinguish between them and use them differently, based on your build use case.


The input secrets are always mounted into the `/var/run/secrets/openshift.io/build` directory, or your builder can parse the `$BUILD` environment variable, which includes the full build object.


Important

If a pull secret for the registry exists in both the namespace and the node, builds default to using the pull secret in the namespace.


### 3.7. External artifacts

It is not recommended to store binary files in a source repository. Therefore, you must define a build which pulls additional files, such as Java `.jar` dependencies, during the build process. How this is done depends on the build strategy you are using.


For a Source build strategy, you must put appropriate shell commands into the `assemble` script:


**`.s2i/bin/assemble` File**

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
#!/bin/sh
APP_VERSION=1.0
wget http://repository.example.com/app/app-$APP_VERSION.jar -O app.jar
```

```shell-session
#!/bin/sh
APP_VERSION=1.0
wget http://repository.example.com/app/app-$APP_VERSION.jar -O app.jar
```

**`.s2i/bin/run` File**

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
#!/bin/sh
exec java -jar app.jar
```

```shell-session
#!/bin/sh
exec java -jar app.jar
```

For a Docker build strategy, you must modify the Dockerfile and invoke shell commands with the [`RUN` instruction](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run):


**Excerpt of Dockerfile**

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
FROM jboss/base-jdk:8

ENV APP_VERSION 1.0
RUN wget http://repository.example.com/app/app-$APP_VERSION.jar -O app.jar

EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "java", "-jar", "app.jar" ]
```

```shell-session
FROM jboss/base-jdk:8

ENV APP_VERSION 1.0
RUN wget http://repository.example.com/app/app-$APP_VERSION.jar -O app.jar

EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "java", "-jar", "app.jar" ]
```

In practice, you may want to use an environment variable for the file location so that the specific file to be downloaded can be customized using an environment variable defined on the `BuildConfig`, rather than updating the Dockerfile or `assemble` script.


You can choose between different methods of defining environment variables:


- Using the `.s2i/environment` file (only for a `Source` build strategy)

- Setting the variables in the `BuildConfig` object

- Providing the variables explicitly using the `oc start-build --env` command (only for builds that are triggered manually)


### 3.8. Using docker credentials for private registries

You can supply builds with a . `docker/config.json` file with valid credentials for private container registries. This allows you to push the output image into a private container image registry or pull a builder image from the private container image registry that requires authentication.


You can supply credentials for multiple repositories within the same registry, each with credentials specific to that registry path.


Note

For the OpenShift Container Platform container image registry, this is not required because secrets are generated automatically for you by OpenShift Container Platform.


The `.docker/config.json` file is found in your home directory by default and has the following format:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
auths:
index.docker.io/v1/:
    auth: "YWRfbGzhcGU6R2labnRib21ifTE="
    email: "user@example.com"

You can define multiple container image registries or define multiple repositories in the same registry. Alternatively, you can also add authentication entries to this file by running the `docker login` command. The file will be created if it does not exist.


Kubernetes provides `Secret` objects, which can be used to store configuration and passwords.


**Prerequisites**

- You must have a `.docker/config.json` file.


**Procedure**

1. Create the secret from your local `.docker/config.json` file by entering the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc create secret generic dockerhub \
       --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path/to/.docker/config.json> \
       --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
```



```shell-session
$ oc create secret generic dockerhub \
       --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path/to/.docker/config.json> \
       --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
```



    This generates a JSON specification of the secret named `dockerhub` and creates the object.


2. Add a `pushSecret` field into the `output` section of the `BuildConfig` and set it to the name of the `secret` that you created, which in the previous example is `dockerhub`:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
spec:
     output:
       to:
         kind: "DockerImage"
         name: "private.registry.com/org/private-image:latest"
       pushSecret:
         name: "dockerhub"
```



```yaml
spec:
     output:
       to:
         kind: "DockerImage"
         name: "private.registry.com/org/private-image:latest"
       pushSecret:
         name: "dockerhub"
```



    You can use the `oc set build-secret` command to set the push secret on the build configuration:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc set build-secret --push bc/sample-build dockerhub
```



```shell-session
$ oc set build-secret --push bc/sample-build dockerhub
```



    You can also link the push secret to the service account used by the build instead of specifying the `pushSecret` field. By default, builds use the `builder` service account. The push secret is automatically added to the build if the secret contains a credential that matches the repository hosting the build’s output image.

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc secrets link builder dockerhub
```



```shell-session
$ oc secrets link builder dockerhub
```

3. Pull the builder container image from a private container image registry by specifying the `pullSecret` field, which is part of the build strategy definition:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
strategy:
     sourceStrategy:
       from:
         kind: "DockerImage"
         name: "docker.io/user/private_repository"
       pullSecret:
         name: "dockerhub"
```



```yaml
strategy:
     sourceStrategy:
       from:
         kind: "DockerImage"
         name: "docker.io/user/private_repository"
       pullSecret:
         name: "dockerhub"
```



    You can use the `oc set build-secret` command to set the pull secret on the build configuration:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc set build-secret --pull bc/sample-build dockerhub
```



```shell-session
$ oc set build-secret --pull bc/sample-build dockerhub
```



Note






This example uses `pullSecret` in a Source build, but it is also applicable in Docker and Custom builds.






    You can also link the pull secret to the service account used by the build instead of specifying the `pullSecret` field. By default, builds use the `builder` service account. The pull secret is automatically added to the build if the secret contains a credential that matches the repository hosting the build’s input image. To link the pull secret to the service account used by the build instead of specifying the `pullSecret` field, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc secrets link builder dockerhub
```



```shell-session
$ oc secrets link builder dockerhub
```



Note






You must specify a `from` image in the `BuildConfig` spec to take advantage of this feature. Docker strategy builds generated by `oc new-build` or `oc new-app` may not do this in some situations.



### 3.9. Build environments

As with pod environment variables, build environment variables can be defined in terms of references to other resources or variables using the Downward API. There are some exceptions, which are noted.


You can also manage environment variables defined in the `BuildConfig` with the `oc set env` command.


Note

Referencing container resources using `valueFrom` in build environment variables is not supported as the references are resolved before the container is created.


#### 3.9.1. Using build fields as environment variables

You can inject information about the build object by setting the `fieldPath` environment variable source to the `JsonPath` of the field from which you are interested in obtaining the value.


Note

Jenkins Pipeline strategy does not support `valueFrom` syntax for environment variables.


**Procedure**

- Set the `fieldPath` environment variable source to the `JsonPath` of the field from which you are interested in obtaining the value:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
env:
  - name: FIELDREF_ENV
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: metadata.name
```

```yaml
env:
  - name: FIELDREF_ENV
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: metadata.name
```

#### 3.9.2. Using secrets as environment variables

You can make key values from secrets available as environment variables using the `valueFrom` syntax.


Important

This method shows the secrets as plain text in the output of the build pod console. To avoid this, use input secrets and config maps instead.


**Procedure**

- To use a secret as an environment variable, set the `valueFrom` syntax:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
    name: secret-example-bc
spec:
    strategy:
      sourceStrategy:
        env:
      - name: MYVAL
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            key: myval
            name: mysecret
```

```yaml
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
name: secret-example-bc
spec:
strategy:
    sourceStrategy:
      env:
      - name: MYVAL
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            key: myval
            name: mysecret
```

### 3.10. Service serving certificate secrets

Service serving certificate secrets are intended to support complex middleware applications that need out-of-the-box certificates. It has the same settings as the server certificates generated by the administrator tooling for nodes and masters.


**Procedure**

To secure communication to your service, have the cluster generate a signed serving certificate/key pair into a secret in your namespace.


- Set the `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name` annotation on your service with the value set to the name you want to use for your secret.



Then, your `PodSpec` can mount that secret. When it is available, your pod runs. The certificate is good for the internal service DNS name, `<service.name>.<service.namespace>.svc`.



The certificate and key are in PEM format, stored in `tls.crt` and `tls.key` respectively. The certificate/key pair is automatically replaced when it gets close to expiration. View the expiration date in the `service.beta.openshift.io/expiry` annotation on the secret, which is in RFC3339 format.



Note

In most cases, the service DNS name `<service.name>.<service.namespace>.svc` is not externally routable. The primary use of `<service.name>.<service.namespace>.svc` is for intracluster or intraservice communication, and with re-encrypt routes.


Other pods can trust cluster-created certificates, which are only signed for internal DNS names, by using the certificate authority (CA) bundle in the `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-ca.crt` file that is automatically mounted in their pod.


The signature algorithm for this feature is `x509.SHA256WithRSA`. To manually rotate, delete the generated secret. A new certificate is created.


### 3.11. Secrets restrictions

To use a secret, a pod needs to reference the secret. A secret can be used with a pod in three ways:


- To populate environment variables for containers.

- As files in a volume mounted on one or more of its containers.

- By kubelet when pulling images for the pod.


Volume type secrets write data into the container as a file using the volume mechanism. `imagePullSecrets` use service accounts for the automatic injection of the secret into all pods in a namespaces.


When a template contains a secret definition, the only way for the template to use the provided secret is to ensure that the secret volume sources are validated and that the specified object reference actually points to an object of type `Secret`. Therefore, a secret needs to be created before any pods that depend on it. The most effective way to ensure this is to have it get injected automatically through the use of a service account.


Secret API objects reside in a namespace. They can only be referenced by pods in that same namespace.


Individual secrets are limited to 1MB in size. This is to discourage the creation of large secrets that would exhaust apiserver and kubelet memory. However, creation of a number of smaller secrets could also exhaust memory.


## Chapter 4. Managing build output

Use the following sections for an overview of and instructions for managing build output.


### 4.1. Build output

Builds that use the docker or source-to-image (S2I) strategy result in the creation of a new container image. The image is then pushed to the container image registry specified in the `output` section of the `Build` specification.


If the output kind is `ImageStreamTag`, then the image will be pushed to the integrated OpenShift image registry and tagged in the specified imagestream. If the output is of type `DockerImage`, then the name of the output reference will be used as a docker push specification. The specification may contain a registry or will default to DockerHub if no registry is specified. If the output section of the build specification is empty, then the image will not be pushed at the end of the build.


**Output to an ImageStreamTag**

```
spec:
output:
    to:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "sample-image:latest"
```

```yaml
spec:
output:
    to:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "sample-image:latest"
```

**Output to a docker Push Specification**

```
spec:
output:
    to:
      kind: "DockerImage"
      name: "my-registry.mycompany.com:5000/myimages/myimage:tag"
```

```yaml
spec:
output:
    to:
      kind: "DockerImage"
      name: "my-registry.mycompany.com:5000/myimages/myimage:tag"
```

### 4.2. Output image environment variables

docker and source-to-image (S2I) strategy builds set the following environment variables on output images:


| Variable | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `OPENSHIFT_BUILD_NAME` | Name of the build |
| `OPENSHIFT_BUILD_NAMESPACE` | Namespace of the build |
| `OPENSHIFT_BUILD_SOURCE` | The source URL of the build |
| `OPENSHIFT_BUILD_REFERENCE` | The Git reference used in the build |
| `OPENSHIFT_BUILD_COMMIT` | Source commit used in the build |

Additionally, any user-defined environment variable, for example those configured with S2I or docker strategy options, will also be part of the output image environment variable list.


### 4.3. Output image labels

docker and source-to-image (S2I) builds set the following labels on output images:


| Label | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `io.openshift.build.commit.author` | Author of the source commit used in the build |
| `io.openshift.build.commit.date` | Date of the source commit used in the build |
| `io.openshift.build.commit.id` | Hash of the source commit used in the build |
| `io.openshift.build.commit.message` | Message of the source commit used in the build |
| `io.openshift.build.commit.ref` | Branch or reference specified in the source |
| `io.openshift.build.source-location` | Source URL for the build |

You can also use the `BuildConfig.spec.output.imageLabels` field to specify a list of custom labels that will be applied to each image built from the build configuration.


**Custom labels for built images**

```
spec:
output:
    to:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "my-image:latest"
    imageLabels:
    - name: "vendor"
      value: "MyCompany"
    - name: "authoritative-source-url"
      value: "registry.mycompany.com"
```

```yaml
spec:
output:
    to:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "my-image:latest"
    imageLabels:
    - name: "vendor"
      value: "MyCompany"
    - name: "authoritative-source-url"
      value: "registry.mycompany.com"
```

## Chapter 5. Using build strategies

The following sections define the primary supported build strategies, and how to use them.


### 5.1. Docker build

OpenShift Container Platform uses Buildah to build a container image from a Dockerfile. For more information on building container images with Dockerfiles, see [the Dockerfile reference documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).


Tip

If you set Docker build arguments by using the `buildArgs` array, see [Understand how ARG and FROM interact](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#understand-how-arg-and-from-interact) in the Dockerfile reference documentation.


#### 5.1.1. Replacing the Dockerfile FROM image

You can replace the `FROM` instruction of the Dockerfile with the `from` parameters of the `BuildConfig` object. If the Dockerfile uses multi-stage builds, the image in the last `FROM` instruction will be replaced.


**Procedure**

- To replace the `FROM` instruction of the Dockerfile with the `from` parameters of the `BuildConfig` object, add the following settings to the `BuildConfig` object:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
strategy:
    dockerStrategy:
      from:
        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "debian:latest"
```



```yaml
strategy:
    dockerStrategy:
      from:
        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "debian:latest"
```


#### 5.1.2. Using Dockerfile path

By default, docker builds use a Dockerfile located at the root of the context specified in the `BuildConfig.spec.source.contextDir` field.


The `dockerfilePath` field allows the build to use a different path to locate your Dockerfile, relative to the `BuildConfig.spec.source.contextDir` field. It can be a different file name than the default Dockerfile, such as `MyDockerfile`, or a path to a Dockerfile in a subdirectory, such as `dockerfiles/app1/Dockerfile`.


**Procedure**

- Set the `dockerfilePath` field for the build to use a different path to locate your Dockerfile:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
strategy:
    dockerStrategy:
      dockerfilePath: dockerfiles/app1/Dockerfile
```



```yaml
strategy:
    dockerStrategy:
      dockerfilePath: dockerfiles/app1/Dockerfile
```


#### 5.1.3. Using docker environment variables

To make environment variables available to the docker build process and resulting image, you can add environment variables to the `dockerStrategy` definition of the build configuration.


The environment variables defined there are inserted as a single `ENV` Dockerfile instruction right after the `FROM` instruction, so that it can be referenced later on within the Dockerfile.


The variables are defined during build and stay in the output image, therefore they will be present in any container that runs that image as well.


For example, defining a custom HTTP proxy to be used during build and runtime:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
dockerStrategy:
...
env:
    - name: "HTTP_PROXY"
      value: "http://myproxy.net:5187/"
```

```yaml
dockerStrategy:
...
env:
    - name: "HTTP_PROXY"
      value: "http://myproxy.net:5187/"
```

You can also manage environment variables defined in the build configuration with the `oc set env` command.


#### 5.1.4. Adding Docker build arguments

You can set [Docker build arguments](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg) using the `buildArgs` array. The build arguments are passed to Docker when a build is started.


Tip

See [Understand how ARG and FROM interact](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#understand-how-arg-and-from-interact) in the Dockerfile reference documentation.


**Procedure**

- To set Docker build arguments, add entries to the `buildArgs` array, which is located in the `dockerStrategy` definition of the `BuildConfig` object. For example:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
dockerStrategy:
...
    buildArgs:
    - name: "version"
      value: "latest"
```

```yaml
dockerStrategy:
...
buildArgs:
    - name: "version"
      value: "latest"
```

Note

Only the `name` and `value` fields are supported. Any settings on the `valueFrom` field are ignored.


#### 5.1.5. Squashing layers with docker builds

Docker builds normally create a layer representing each instruction in a Dockerfile. Setting the `imageOptimizationPolicy` to `SkipLayers` merges all instructions into a single layer on top of the base image.


**Procedure**

- Set the `imageOptimizationPolicy` to `SkipLayers`:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
strategy:
    dockerStrategy:
      imageOptimizationPolicy: SkipLayers
```



```yaml
strategy:
    dockerStrategy:
      imageOptimizationPolicy: SkipLayers
```


#### 5.1.6. Using build volumes

You can mount build volumes to give running builds access to information that you do not want to persist in the output container image.


Build volumes provide sensitive information, such as repository credentials, that the build environment or configuration only needs at build time. Build volumes are different from build inputs, whose data can persist in the output container image.


The mount points of build volumes, from which the running build reads data, are functionally similar to [pod volume mounts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/).


**Prerequisites**

- You have added an input secret, config map, or both to a BuildConfig object.


**Procedure**

- In the `dockerStrategy` definition of the `BuildConfig` object, add any build volumes to the `volumes` array. For example:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
spec:
    dockerStrategy:
      volumes:
      - name: secret-mvn
        mounts:
        - destinationPath: /opt/app-root/src/.ssh
        source:
          type: Secret
          secret:
            secretName: my-secret
      - name: settings-mvn
        mounts:
        - destinationPath: /opt/app-root/src/.m2
        source:
          type: ConfigMap
          configMap:
            name: my-config
      - name: my-csi-volume
        mounts:
        - destinationPath: /opt/app-root/src/some_path
        source:
          type: CSI
          csi:
            driver: csi.sharedresource.openshift.io
            readOnly: true
            volumeAttributes:
              attribute: value
```

### 5.2. Source-to-image build

Source-to-image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible container images. It produces ready-to-run images by injecting application source into a container image and assembling a new image. The new image incorporates the base image, the builder, and built source and is ready to use with the `buildah run` command. S2I supports incremental builds, which re-use previously downloaded dependencies, previously built artifacts, and so on.


#### 5.2.1. Performing source-to-image incremental builds

Source-to-image (S2I) can perform incremental builds, which means it reuses artifacts from previously-built images.


**Procedure**

- To create an incremental build, create a with the following modification to the strategy definition:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
strategy:
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "incremental-image:latest"
      incremental: true
```



```yaml
strategy:
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "incremental-image:latest"
```

1

```yaml

      incremental: true
```

2

```yaml

```


[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO15-1)


Specify an image that supports incremental builds. Consult the documentation of the builder image to determine if it supports this behavior.


[2](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO15-2)


This flag controls whether an incremental build is attempted. If the builder image does not support incremental builds, the build will still succeed, but you will get a log message stating the incremental build was not successful because of a missing `save-artifacts` script.



**Additional resources**

- See S2I Requirements for information on how to create a builder image supporting incremental builds.


#### 5.2.2. Overriding source-to-image builder image scripts

You can override the `assemble`, `run`, and `save-artifacts` source-to-image (S2I) scripts provided by the builder image.


**Procedure**

- To override the `assemble`, `run`, and `save-artifacts` S2I scripts provided by the builder image, complete one of the following actions:




- Provide an `assemble`, `run`, or `save-artifacts` script in the `.s2i/bin` directory of your application source repository.

- Provide a URL of a directory containing the scripts as part of the strategy definition in the `BuildConfig` object. For example:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
strategy:
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "builder-image:latest"
      scripts: "http://somehost.com/scripts_directory"
```



```yaml
strategy:
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "builder-image:latest"
      scripts: "http://somehost.com/scripts_directory"
```

1

```yaml

```


[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO16-1)


The build process appends `run`, `assemble`, and `save-artifacts` to the path. If any or all scripts with these names exist, the build process uses these scripts in place of scripts with the same name that are provided in the image.





Note






Files located at the `scripts` URL take precedence over files located in `.s2i/bin` of the source repository.



#### 5.2.3. Source-to-image environment variables

There are two ways to make environment variables available to the source build process and resulting image: environment files and `BuildConfig` environment values. The variables that you provide using either method will be present during the build process and in the output image.


##### 5.2.3.1. Using source-to-image environment files

Source build enables you to set environment values, one per line, inside your application, by specifying them in a `.s2i/environment` file in the source repository. The environment variables specified in this file are present during the build process and in the output image.


If you provide a `.s2i/environment` file in your source repository, source-to-image (S2I) reads this file during the build. This allows customization of the build behavior as the `assemble` script may use these variables.


**Procedure**

For example, to disable assets compilation for your Rails application during the build:


- Add `DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION=true` in the `.s2i/environment` file.


In addition to builds, the specified environment variables are also available in the running application itself. For example, to cause the Rails application to start in `development` mode instead of `production`:


- Add `RAILS_ENV=development` to the `.s2i/environment` file.


The complete list of supported environment variables is available in the using images section for each image.


##### 5.2.3.2. Using source-to-image build configuration environment

You can add environment variables to the `sourceStrategy` definition of the build configuration. The environment variables defined there are visible during the `assemble` script execution and will be defined in the output image, making them also available to the `run` script and application code.


**Procedure**

- For example, to disable assets compilation for your Rails application:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
sourceStrategy:
...
    env:
    - name: "DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION"
      value: "true"
```

```yaml
sourceStrategy:
...
env:
    - name: "DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION"
      value: "true"
```

**Additional resources**

- The build environment section provides more advanced instructions.

- You can also manage environment variables defined in the build configuration with the `oc set env` command.


#### 5.2.4. Ignoring source-to-image source files

Source-to-image (S2I) supports a `.s2iignore` file, which contains a list of file patterns that should be ignored. Files in the build working directory, as provided by the various input sources, that match a pattern found in the `.s2iignore` file will not be made available to the `assemble` script.


#### 5.2.5. Creating images from source code with source-to-image

Source-to-image (S2I) is a framework that makes it easy to write images that take application source code as an input and produce a new image that runs the assembled application as output.


The main advantage of using S2I for building reproducible container images is the ease of use for developers. As a builder image author, you must understand two basic concepts in order for your images to provide the best S2I performance, the build process and S2I scripts.


##### 5.2.5.1. Understanding the source-to-image build process

The build process consists of the following three fundamental elements, which are combined into a final container image:


- Sources

- Source-to-image (S2I) scripts

- Builder image


S2I generates a Dockerfile with the builder image as the first `FROM` instruction. The Dockerfile generated by S2I is then passed to Buildah.


##### 5.2.5.2. How to write source-to-image scripts

You can write source-to-image (S2I) scripts in any programming language, as long as the scripts are executable inside the builder image. S2I supports multiple options providing `assemble`/ `run`/ `save-artifacts` scripts. All of these locations are checked on each build in the following order:


1. A script specified in the build configuration.

2. A script found in the application source `.s2i/bin` directory.

3. A script found at the default image URL with the `io.openshift.s2i.scripts-url` label.


Both the `io.openshift.s2i.scripts-url` label specified in the image and the script specified in a build configuration can take one of the following forms:


- `image:///path_to_scripts_dir`: absolute path inside the image to a directory where the S2I scripts are located.

- `file:///path_to_scripts_dir`: relative or absolute path to a directory on the host where the S2I scripts are located.

- `http(s)://path_to_scripts_dir`: URL to a directory where the S2I scripts are located.


| Script | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `assemble` | The `assemble` script builds the application artifacts from a source and places them into appropriate directories inside the image. This script is required. The workflow for this script is:<br> <br>1. Optional: Restore build artifacts. If you want to support incremental builds, make sure to define `save-artifacts` as well.<br>    <br>2. Place the application source in the desired location.<br>    <br>3. Build the application artifacts.<br>    <br>4. Install the artifacts into locations appropriate for them to run. |
| `run` | The `run` script executes your application. This script is required. |
| `save-artifacts` | The `save-artifacts` script gathers all dependencies that can speed up the build processes that follow. This script is optional. For example:<br> <br>- For Ruby, `gems` installed by Bundler.<br>   <br>- For Java, `.m2` contents.<br>   <br>These dependencies are gathered into a `tar` file and streamed to the standard output. |
| `usage` | The `usage` script allows you to inform the user how to properly use your image. This script is optional. |
| `test/run` | The `test/run` script allows you to create a process to check if the image is working correctly. This script is optional. The proposed flow of that process is:<br> <br>1. Build the image.<br>    <br>2. Run the image to verify the `usage` script.<br>    <br>3. Run `s2i build` to verify the `assemble` script.<br>    <br>4. Optional: Run `s2i build` again to verify the `save-artifacts` and `assemble` scripts save and restore artifacts functionality.<br>    <br>5. Run the image to verify the test application is working.<br>    <br>Note<br>The suggested location to put the test application built by your `test/run` script is the `test/test-app` directory in your image repository. |

#### 5.2.6. Using build volumes

You can mount build volumes to give running builds access to information that you do not want to persist in the output container image.


Build volumes provide sensitive information, such as repository credentials, that the build environment or configuration only needs at build time. Build volumes are different from build inputs, whose data can persist in the output container image.


The mount points of build volumes, from which the running build reads data, are functionally similar to [pod volume mounts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/).


**Prerequisites**

- You have added an input secret, config map, or both to a BuildConfig object.


**Procedure**

- In the `sourceStrategy` definition of the `BuildConfig` object, add any build volumes to the `volumes` array. For example:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
spec:
    sourceStrategy:
      volumes:
      - name: secret-mvn
        mounts:
        - destinationPath: /opt/app-root/src/.ssh
        source:
          type: Secret
          secret:
            secretName: my-secret
      - name: settings-mvn
        mounts:
        - destinationPath: /opt/app-root/src/.m2
        source:
          type: ConfigMap
          configMap:
            name: my-config
      - name: my-csi-volume
        mounts:
        - destinationPath: /opt/app-root/src/some_path
        source:
          type: CSI
          csi:
            driver: csi.sharedresource.openshift.io

### 5.3. Custom build

The custom build strategy allows developers to define a specific builder image responsible for the entire build process. Using your own builder image allows you to customize your build process.


A custom builder image is a plain container image embedded with build process logic, for example for building RPMs or base images.


Custom builds run with a high level of privilege and are not available to users by default. Only users who can be trusted with cluster administration permissions should be granted access to run custom builds.


#### 5.3.1. Using FROM image for custom builds

You can use the `customStrategy.from` section to indicate the image to use for the custom build.


**Procedure**

- Set the `customStrategy.from` section:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
strategy:
    customStrategy:
      from:
        kind: "DockerImage"
        name: "openshift/sti-image-builder"
```



```yaml
strategy:
    customStrategy:
      from:
        kind: "DockerImage"
        name: "openshift/sti-image-builder"
```


#### 5.3.2. Using secrets in custom builds

In addition to secrets for source and images that can be added to all build types, custom strategies allow adding an arbitrary list of secrets to the builder pod.


**Procedure**

- To mount each secret at a specific location, edit the `secretSource` and `mountPath` fields of the `strategy` YAML file:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
strategy:
    customStrategy:
      secrets:
      - secretSource:
          name: "secret1"
        mountPath: "/tmp/secret1"
      - secretSource:
          name: "secret2"
        mountPath: "/tmp/secret2"
```

```yaml
strategy:
customStrategy:
    secrets:
      - secretSource:
```

1

```yaml

          name: "secret1"
        mountPath: "/tmp/secret1"
```

2

```yaml

      - secretSource:
          name: "secret2"
        mountPath: "/tmp/secret2"
```

[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO18-1)

`secretSource` is a reference to a secret in the same namespace as the build.


[2](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO18-2)

`mountPath` is the path inside the custom builder where the secret should be mounted.


#### 5.3.3. Using environment variables for custom builds

To make environment variables available to the custom build process, you can add environment variables to the `customStrategy` definition of the build configuration.


The environment variables defined there are passed to the pod that runs the custom build.


**Procedure**

1. Define a custom HTTP proxy to be used during build:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
customStrategy:
...
     env:
    - name: "HTTP_PROXY"
      value: "http://myproxy.net:5187/"
```

```yaml
customStrategy:
...
env:
    - name: "HTTP_PROXY"
      value: "http://myproxy.net:5187/"
```

2. To manage environment variables defined in the build configuration, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc set env <enter_variables>
```



```shell-session
$ oc set env <enter_variables>
```


#### 5.3.4. Using custom builder images

OpenShift Container Platform’s custom build strategy enables you to define a specific builder image responsible for the entire build process. When you need a build to produce individual artifacts such as packages, JARs, WARs, installable ZIPs, or base images, use a custom builder image using the custom build strategy.


A custom builder image is a plain container image embedded with build process logic, which is used for building artifacts such as RPMs or base container images.


Additionally, the custom builder allows implementing any extended build process, such as a CI/CD flow that runs unit or integration tests.


##### 5.3.4.1. Custom builder image

Upon invocation, a custom builder image receives the following environment variables with the information needed to proceed with the build:


| Variable Name | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `BUILD` | The entire serialized JSON of the `Build` object definition. If you must use a specific API version for serialization, you can set the `buildAPIVersion` parameter in the custom strategy specification of the build configuration. |
| `SOURCE_REPOSITORY` | The URL of a Git repository with source to be built. |
| `SOURCE_URI` | Uses the same value as `SOURCE_REPOSITORY`. Either can be used. |
| `SOURCE_CONTEXT_DIR` | Specifies the subdirectory of the Git repository to be used when building. Only present if defined. |
| `SOURCE_REF` | The Git reference to be built. |
| `ORIGIN_VERSION` | The version of the OpenShift Container Platform master that created this build object. |
| `OUTPUT_REGISTRY` | The container image registry to push the image to. |
| `OUTPUT_IMAGE` | The container image tag name for the image being built. |
| `PUSH_DOCKERCFG_PATH` | The path to the container registry credentials for running a `podman push` operation. |

Table 5.2. Custom Builder Environment Variables

##### 5.3.4.2. Custom builder workflow

Although custom builder image authors have flexibility in defining the build process, your builder image must adhere to the following required steps necessary for running a build inside of OpenShift Container Platform:


1. The `Build` object definition contains all the necessary information about input parameters for the build.

2. Run the build process.

3. If your build produces an image, push it to the output location of the build if it is defined. Other output locations can be passed with environment variables.


### 5.4. Pipeline build

Important

The Pipeline build strategy is deprecated in OpenShift Container Platform 4. Equivalent and improved functionality is present in the OpenShift Container Platform Pipelines based on Tekton.


Jenkins images on OpenShift Container Platform are fully supported and users should follow Jenkins user documentation for defining their `jenkinsfile` in a job or store it in a Source Control Management system.


The Pipeline build strategy allows developers to define a Jenkins pipeline for use by the Jenkins pipeline plugin. The build can be started, monitored, and managed by OpenShift Container Platform in the same way as any other build type.


Pipeline workflows are defined in a `jenkinsfile`, either embedded directly in the build configuration, or supplied in a Git repository and referenced by the build configuration.


#### 5.4.1. Understanding OpenShift Container Platform pipelines

Important

The Pipeline build strategy is deprecated in OpenShift Container Platform 4. Equivalent and improved functionality is present in the OpenShift Container Platform Pipelines based on Tekton.


Jenkins images on OpenShift Container Platform are fully supported and users should follow Jenkins user documentation for defining their `jenkinsfile` in a job or store it in a Source Control Management system.


Pipelines give you control over building, deploying, and promoting your applications on OpenShift Container Platform. Using a combination of the Jenkins Pipeline build strategy, `jenkinsfiles`, and the OpenShift Container Platform Domain Specific Language (DSL) provided by the Jenkins Client Plugin, you can create advanced build, test, deploy, and promote pipelines for any scenario.


**OpenShift Container Platform Jenkins Sync Plugin**

The OpenShift Container Platform Jenkins Sync Plugin keeps the build configuration and build objects in sync with Jenkins jobs and builds, and provides the following:


- Dynamic job and run creation in Jenkins.

- Dynamic creation of agent pod templates from image streams, image stream tags, or config maps.

- Injection of environment variables.

- Pipeline visualization in the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

- Integration with the Jenkins Git plugin, which passes commit information from OpenShift Container Platform builds to the Jenkins Git plugin.

- Synchronization of secrets into Jenkins credential entries.


**OpenShift Container Platform Jenkins Client Plugin**

The OpenShift Container Platform Jenkins Client Plugin is a Jenkins plugin which aims to provide a readable, concise, comprehensive, and fluent Jenkins Pipeline syntax for rich interactions with an OpenShift Container Platform API Server. The plugin uses the OpenShift Container Platform command-line tool, `oc`, which must be available on the nodes executing the script.


The Jenkins Client Plugin must be installed on your Jenkins master so the OpenShift Container Platform DSL will be available to use within the `jenkinsfile` for your application. This plugin is installed and enabled by default when using the OpenShift Container Platform Jenkins image.


For OpenShift Container Platform Pipelines within your project, you will must use the Jenkins Pipeline Build Strategy. This strategy defaults to using a `jenkinsfile` at the root of your source repository, but also provides the following configuration options:


- An inline `jenkinsfile` field within your build configuration.

- A `jenkinsfilePath` field within your build configuration that references the location of the `jenkinsfile` to use relative to the source `contextDir`.


Note

The optional `jenkinsfilePath` field specifies the name of the file to use, relative to the source `contextDir`. If `contextDir` is omitted, it defaults to the root of the repository. If `jenkinsfilePath` is omitted, it defaults to `jenkinsfile`.


#### 5.4.2. Providing the Jenkins file for pipeline builds

Important

The Pipeline build strategy is deprecated in OpenShift Container Platform 4. Equivalent and improved functionality is present in the OpenShift Container Platform Pipelines based on Tekton.


Jenkins images on OpenShift Container Platform are fully supported and users should follow Jenkins user documentation for defining their `jenkinsfile` in a job or store it in a Source Control Management system.


The `jenkinsfile` uses the standard groovy language syntax to allow fine grained control over the configuration, build, and deployment of your application.


You can supply the `jenkinsfile` in one of the following ways:


- A file located within your source code repository.

- Embedded as part of your build configuration using the `jenkinsfile` field.


When using the first option, the `jenkinsfile` must be included in your applications source code repository at one of the following locations:


- A file named `jenkinsfile` at the root of your repository.

- A file named `jenkinsfile` at the root of the source `contextDir` of your repository.

- A file name specified via the `jenkinsfilePath` field of the `JenkinsPipelineStrategy` section of your BuildConfig, which is relative to the source `contextDir` if supplied, otherwise it defaults to the root of the repository.


The `jenkinsfile` is run on the Jenkins agent pod, which must have the OpenShift Container Platform client binaries available if you intend to use the OpenShift Container Platform DSL.


**Procedure**

To provide the Jenkins file, you can either:


- Embed the Jenkins file in the build configuration.

- Include in the build configuration a reference to the Git repository that contains the Jenkins file.


**Embedded Definition**

The optional `jenkinsfilePath` field specifies the name of the file to use, relative to the source `contextDir`. If `contextDir` is omitted, it defaults to the root of the repository. If `jenkinsfilePath` is omitted, it defaults to `jenkinsfile`.


#### 5.4.3. Using environment variables for pipeline builds

Important

The Pipeline build strategy is deprecated in OpenShift Container Platform 4. Equivalent and improved functionality is present in the OpenShift Container Platform Pipelines based on Tekton.


Jenkins images on OpenShift Container Platform are fully supported and users should follow Jenkins user documentation for defining their `jenkinsfile` in a job or store it in a Source Control Management system.


To make environment variables available to the Pipeline build process, you can add environment variables to the `jenkinsPipelineStrategy` definition of the build configuration.


Once defined, the environment variables will be set as parameters for any Jenkins job associated with the build configuration.


**Procedure**

- To define environment variables to be used during build, edit the YAML file:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
jenkinsPipelineStrategy:
...
    env:
    - name: "FOO"
      value: "BAR"
```

```yaml
jenkinsPipelineStrategy:
...
env:
    - name: "FOO"
      value: "BAR"
```

You can also manage environment variables defined in the build configuration with the `oc set env` command.


##### 5.4.3.1. Mapping between BuildConfig environment variables and Jenkins job parameters

When a Jenkins job is created or updated based on changes to a Pipeline strategy build configuration, any environment variables in the build configuration are mapped to Jenkins job parameters definitions, where the default values for the Jenkins job parameters definitions are the current values of the associated environment variables.


After the Jenkins job’s initial creation, you can still add additional parameters to the job from the Jenkins console. The parameter names differ from the names of the environment variables in the build configuration. The parameters are honored when builds are started for those Jenkins jobs.


How you start builds for the Jenkins job dictates how the parameters are set.


- If you start with `oc start-build`, the values of the environment variables in the build configuration are the parameters set for the corresponding job instance. Any changes you make to the parameters' default values from the Jenkins console are ignored. The build configuration values take precedence.

- If you start with `oc start-build -e`, the values for the environment variables specified in the `-e` option take precedence.




- If you specify an environment variable not listed in the build configuration, they will be added as a Jenkins job parameter definitions.

- Any changes you make from the Jenkins console to the parameters corresponding to the environment variables are ignored. The build configuration and what you specify with `oc start-build -e` takes precedence.


- If you start the Jenkins job with the Jenkins console, then you can control the setting of the parameters with the Jenkins console as part of starting a build for the job.


Note

It is recommended that you specify in the build configuration all possible environment variables to be associated with job parameters. Doing so reduces disk I/O and improves performance during Jenkins processing.


#### 5.4.4. Pipeline build tutorial

Important

The Pipeline build strategy is deprecated in OpenShift Container Platform 4. Equivalent and improved functionality is present in the OpenShift Container Platform Pipelines based on Tekton.


Jenkins images on OpenShift Container Platform are fully supported and users should follow Jenkins user documentation for defining their `jenkinsfile` in a job or store it in a Source Control Management system.


This example demonstrates how to create an OpenShift Container Platform Pipeline that will build, deploy, and verify a `Node.js/MongoDB` application using the `nodejs-mongodb.json` template.


**Procedure**

1. Create the Jenkins master:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc project <project_name>
```



```shell-session
     $ oc project <project_name>
```



    Select the project that you want to use or create a new project with `oc new-project <project_name>`.

    If you want to use persistent storage, use `jenkins-persistent` instead.


2. Create a file named `nodejs-sample-pipeline.yaml` with the following content:



Note






This creates a `BuildConfig` object that employs the Jenkins pipeline strategy to build, deploy, and scale the `Node.js/MongoDB` example application.

       type: JenkinsPipeline
```



```yaml
kind: "BuildConfig"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
     name: "nodejs-sample-pipeline"
spec:
     strategy:
       jenkinsPipelineStrategy:
         jenkinsfile: <pipeline content from below>
       type: JenkinsPipeline
```

3. After you create a `BuildConfig` object with a `jenkinsPipelineStrategy`, tell the pipeline what to do by using an inline `jenkinsfile`:



Note






This example does not set up a Git repository for the application.





The following `jenkinsfile` content is written in Groovy using the OpenShift Container Platform DSL. For this example, include inline content in the `BuildConfig` object using the YAML Literal Style, though including a `jenkinsfile` in your source repository is the preferred method.

If everything else succeeded, tag the `$ {templateName}:latest` image as `$ {templateName}-staging:latest`. A pipeline build configuration for the staging environment can watch for the `$ {templateName}-staging:latest` image to change and then deploy it to the staging environment.





Note






The previous example was written using the declarative pipeline style, but the older scripted pipeline style is also supported.


4. Create the Pipeline `BuildConfig` in your OpenShift Container Platform cluster:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc create -f nodejs-sample-pipeline.yaml
```



```shell-session
$ oc create -f nodejs-sample-pipeline.yaml
```




1. If you do not want to create your own file, you can use the sample from the Origin repository by running:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/examples/jenkins/pipeline/nodejs-sample-pipeline.yaml
```



```shell-session
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/examples/jenkins/pipeline/nodejs-sample-pipeline.yaml
```


5. Start the Pipeline:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc start-build nodejs-sample-pipeline
```



```shell-session
$ oc start-build nodejs-sample-pipeline
```



Note






Alternatively, you can start your pipeline with the OpenShift Container Platform web console by navigating to the Builds → Pipeline section and clicking **Start Pipeline**, or by visiting the Jenkins Console, navigating to the Pipeline that you created, and clicking **Build Now**.






    Once the pipeline is started, you should see the following actions performed within your project:




- A job instance is created on the Jenkins server.

- An agent pod is launched, if your pipeline requires one.

- The pipeline runs on the agent pod, or the master if no agent is required.




- Any previously created resources with the `template=nodejs-mongodb-example` label will be deleted.

- A new application, and all of its associated resources, will be created from the `nodejs-mongodb-example` template.

- A build will be started using the `nodejs-mongodb-example` `BuildConfig`.




- The pipeline will wait until the build has completed to trigger the next stage.


- A deployment will be started using the `nodejs-mongodb-example` deployment configuration.




- The pipeline will wait until the deployment has completed to trigger the next stage.


- If the build and deploy are successful, the `nodejs-mongodb-example:latest` image will be tagged as `nodejs-mongodb-example:stage`.


- The agent pod is deleted, if one was required for the pipeline.



Note






The best way to visualize the pipeline execution is by viewing it in the OpenShift Container Platform web console. You can view your pipelines by logging in to the web console and navigating to Builds → Pipelines.



### 5.5. Adding secrets with web console

You can add a secret to your build configuration so that it can access a private repository.


**Procedure**

To add a secret to your build configuration so that it can access a private repository from the OpenShift Container Platform web console:


1. Create a new OpenShift Container Platform project.

2. Create a secret that contains credentials for accessing a private source code repository.

3. Create a build configuration.

4. On the build configuration editor page or in the `create app from builder image` page of the web console, set the **Source Secret**.

5. Click **Save**.


### 5.6. Enabling pulling and pushing

You can enable pulling to a private registry by setting the pull secret and pushing by setting the push secret in the build configuration.


**Procedure**

To enable pulling to a private registry:


- Set the pull secret in the build configuration.


To enable pushing:


- Set the push secret in the build configuration.


## Chapter 6. Custom image builds with Buildah

With OpenShift Container Platform 4.18, a docker socket will not be present on the host nodes. This means the _mount docker socket_ option of a custom build is not guaranteed to provide an accessible docker socket for use within a custom build image.


If you require this capability in order to build and push images, add the Buildah tool your custom build image and use it to build and push the image within your custom build logic. The following is an example of how to run custom builds with Buildah.


Note

Using the custom build strategy requires permissions that normal users do not have by default because it allows the user to execute arbitrary code inside a privileged container running on the cluster. This level of access can be used to compromise the cluster and therefore should be granted only to users who are trusted with administrative privileges on the cluster.


### 6.1. Prerequisites

- Review how to [grant custom build permissions](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#securing-builds-by-strategy "Chapter 11. Securing builds by strategy").


### 6.2. Creating custom build artifacts

You must create the image you want to use as your custom build image.


**Procedure**

1. Starting with an empty directory, create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
FROM registry.redhat.io/rhel8/buildah
# In this example, `/tmp/build` contains the inputs that build when this
# custom builder image is run. Normally the custom builder image fetches
# this content from some location at build time, by using git clone as an example.
ADD dockerfile.sample /tmp/input/Dockerfile
ADD build.sh /usr/bin
RUN chmod a+x /usr/bin/build.sh
# /usr/bin/build.sh contains the actual custom build logic that will be run when
# this custom builder image is run.
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/build.sh"]
```



```shell-session
FROM registry.redhat.io/rhel8/buildah
# In this example, `/tmp/build` contains the inputs that build when this
# custom builder image is run. Normally the custom builder image fetches
# this content from some location at build time, by using git clone as an example.
ADD dockerfile.sample /tmp/input/Dockerfile
ADD build.sh /usr/bin
RUN chmod a+x /usr/bin/build.sh
# /usr/bin/build.sh contains the actual custom build logic that will be run when
# this custom builder image is run.
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/build.sh"]
```

2. In the same directory, create a file named `dockerfile.sample`. This file is included in the custom build image and defines the image that is produced by the custom build:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi
RUN touch /tmp/build
```



```shell-session
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi
RUN touch /tmp/build
```

3. In the same directory, create a file named `build.sh`. This file contains the logic that is run when the custom build runs:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
Note that in this case the build inputs are part of the custom builder image, but normally this
is retrieved from an external source.
OUTPUT_REGISTRY and OUTPUT_IMAGE are env variables provided by the custom
build framework
performs the build of the new image defined by dockerfile.sample
buildah requires a slight modification to the push secret provided by the service
account to use it for pushing the image
push the new image to the target for the build
```



```shell-session
#!/bin/sh
# Note that in this case the build inputs are part of the custom builder image, but normally this
# is retrieved from an external source.
cd /tmp/input
# OUTPUT_REGISTRY and OUTPUT_IMAGE are env variables provided by the custom
# build framework
TAG="${OUTPUT_REGISTRY}/${OUTPUT_IMAGE}"


# performs the build of the new image defined by dockerfile.sample
buildah --storage-driver vfs bud --isolation chroot -t ${TAG} .


# buildah requires a slight modification to the push secret provided by the service
# account to use it for pushing the image
cp /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/push/.dockercfg /tmp
(echo "{ \"auths\": " ; cat /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/push/.dockercfg ; echo "}") > /tmp/.dockercfg


# push the new image to the target for the build
buildah --storage-driver vfs push --tls-verify=false --authfile /tmp/.dockercfg ${TAG}
```


### 6.3. Build custom builder image

You can use OpenShift Container Platform to build and push custom builder images to use in a custom strategy.


**Prerequisites**

- Define all the inputs that will go into creating your new custom builder image.


**Procedure**

1. Define a `BuildConfig` object that will build your custom builder image:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc new-build --binary --strategy=docker --name custom-builder-image
```



```shell-session
$ oc new-build --binary --strategy=docker --name custom-builder-image
```

2. From the directory in which you created your custom build image, run the build:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc start-build custom-builder-image --from-dir . -F
```



```shell-session
$ oc start-build custom-builder-image --from-dir . -F
```



    After the build completes, your new custom builder image is available in your project in an image stream tag that is named `custom-builder-image:latest`.



### 6.4. Use custom builder image

You can define a `BuildConfig` object that uses the custom strategy in conjunction with your custom builder image to execute your custom build logic.


**Prerequisites**

- Define all the required inputs for new custom builder image.

- Build your custom builder image.


**Procedure**

1. Create a file named `buildconfig.yaml`. This file defines the `BuildConfig` object that is created in your project and executed:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
kind: BuildConfig
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
     name: sample-custom-build
     labels:
       name: sample-custom-build
     annotations:
       template.alpha.openshift.io/wait-for-ready: 'true'
spec:
     strategy:
       type: Custom
       customStrategy:
         forcePull: true
         from:
           kind: ImageStreamTag
           name: custom-builder-image:latest
           namespace: <yourproject>
     output:
       to:
         kind: ImageStreamTag
         name: sample-custom:latest
```



```yaml
kind: BuildConfig
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
     name: sample-custom-build
     labels:
       name: sample-custom-build
     annotations:
       template.alpha.openshift.io/wait-for-ready: 'true'
spec:
     strategy:
       type: Custom
       customStrategy:
         forcePull: true
         from:
           kind: ImageStreamTag
           name: custom-builder-image:latest
           namespace: <yourproject>
```

1

```yaml

     output:
       to:
         kind: ImageStreamTag
         name: sample-custom:latest
```


[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO21-1)


Specify your project name.


2. Create the `BuildConfig` object by entering the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc create -f buildconfig.yaml
```



```shell-session
$ oc create -f buildconfig.yaml
```

3. Create a file named `imagestream.yaml`. This file defines the image stream to which the build will push the image:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
kind: ImageStream
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
     name: sample-custom
spec: {}
```



```yaml
kind: ImageStream
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
     name: sample-custom
spec: {}
```

4. Create the image stream by entering the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc create -f imagestream.yaml
```



```shell-session
$ oc create -f imagestream.yaml
```

5. Run your custom build by entering the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc start-build sample-custom-build -F
```



```shell-session
$ oc start-build sample-custom-build -F
```



    When the build runs, it launches a pod running the custom builder image that was built earlier. The pod runs the `build.sh` logic that is defined as the entrypoint for the custom builder image. The `build.sh` logic invokes Buildah to build the `dockerfile.sample` that was embedded in the custom builder image, and then uses Buildah to push the new image to the `sample-custom image stream`.



## Chapter 7. Performing and configuring basic builds

The following sections provide instructions for basic build operations, including starting and canceling builds, editing `BuildConfigs`, deleting `BuildConfigs`, viewing build details, and accessing build logs.


### 7.1. Starting a build

You can manually start a new build from an existing build configuration in your current project.


**Procedure**

- To start a build manually, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc start-build <buildconfig_name>
```



```shell-session
$ oc start-build <buildconfig_name>
```


#### 7.1.1. Re-running a build

You can manually re-run a build using the `--from-build` flag.


**Procedure**

- To manually re-run a build, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc start-build --from-build=<build_name>
```



```shell-session
$ oc start-build --from-build=<build_name>
```


#### 7.1.2. Streaming build logs

You can specify the `--follow` flag to stream the build’s logs in `stdout`.


**Procedure**

- To manually stream a build’s logs in `stdout`, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc start-build <buildconfig_name> --follow
```



```shell-session
$ oc start-build <buildconfig_name> --follow
```


#### 7.1.3. Setting environment variables when starting a build

You can specify the `--env` flag to set any desired environment variable for the build.


**Procedure**

- To specify a desired environment variable, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc start-build <buildconfig_name> --env=<key>=<value>
```



```shell-session
$ oc start-build <buildconfig_name> --env=<key>=<value>
```


#### 7.1.4. Starting a build with source

Rather than relying on a Git source pull or a Dockerfile for a build, you can also start a build by directly pushing your source, which could be the contents of a Git or SVN working directory, a set of pre-built binary artifacts you want to deploy, or a single file. This can be done by specifying one of the following options for the `start-build` command:


| Option | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `--from-dir=<directory>` | Specifies a directory that will be archived and used as a binary input for the build. |
| `--from-file=<file>` | Specifies a single file that will be the only file in the build source. The file is placed in the root of an empty directory with the same file name as the original file provided. |
| `--from-repo=<local_source_repo>` | Specifies a path to a local repository to use as the binary input for a build. Add the `--commit` option to control which branch, tag, or commit is used for the build. |

When passing any of these options directly to the build, the contents are streamed to the build and override the current build source settings.


Note

Builds triggered from binary input will not preserve the source on the server, so rebuilds triggered by base image changes will use the source specified in the build configuration.


**Procedure**

- To start a build from a source code repository and send the contents of a local Git repository as an archive from the tag `v2`, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc start-build hello-world --from-repo=../hello-world --commit=v2
```



```shell-session
$ oc start-build hello-world --from-repo=../hello-world --commit=v2
```


### 7.2. Canceling a build

You can cancel a build using the web console, or with the following CLI command.


**Procedure**

- To manually cancel a build, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc cancel-build <build_name>
```



```shell-session
$ oc cancel-build <build_name>
```


#### 7.2.1. Canceling multiple builds

You can cancel multiple builds with the following CLI command.


**Procedure**

- To manually cancel multiple builds, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc cancel-build <build1_name> <build2_name> <build3_name>
```



```shell-session
$ oc cancel-build <build1_name> <build2_name> <build3_name>
```


#### 7.2.2. Canceling all builds

You can cancel all builds from the build configuration with the following CLI command.


**Procedure**

- To cancel all builds, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc cancel-build bc/<buildconfig_name>
```



```shell-session
$ oc cancel-build bc/<buildconfig_name>
```


#### 7.2.3. Canceling all builds in a given state

You can cancel all builds in a given state, such as `new` or `pending`, while ignoring the builds in other states.


**Procedure**

- To cancel all in a given state, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc cancel-build bc/<buildconfig_name>
```



```shell-session
$ oc cancel-build bc/<buildconfig_name>
```


### 7.3. Editing a BuildConfig

To edit your build configurations, you use the **Edit BuildConfig** option in the **Builds** view of the **Developer** perspective.


You can use either of the following views to edit a `BuildConfig`:


- The **Form view** enables you to edit your `BuildConfig` using the standard form fields and checkboxes.

- The **YAML view** enables you to edit your `BuildConfig` with full control over the operations.


You can switch between the **Form view** and **YAML view** without losing any data. The data in the **Form view** is transferred to the **YAML view** and vice versa.


**Procedure**

1. In the **Builds** view of the **Developer** perspective, click the Options menu
    ![kebab](https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/d/OpenShift_Container_Platform-4.18-Builds_using_BuildConfig-en-US/images/f468284ec3cc9bf27e6bd2c83849ca50/kebab.png)
    to see the **Edit BuildConfig** option.

2. Click **Edit BuildConfig** to see the **Form view** option.

3. In the **Git** section, enter the Git repository URL for the codebase you want to use to create an application. The URL is then validated.




- Optional: Click **Show Advanced Git Options** to add details such as:




- **Git Reference** to specify a branch, tag, or commit that contains code you want to use to build the application.

- **Context Dir** to specify the subdirectory that contains code you want to use to build the application.

- **Source Secret** to create a **Secret Name** with credentials for pulling your source code from a private repository.


4. In the **Build from** section, select the option that you would like to build from. You can use the following options:




- **Image Stream tag** references an image for a given image stream and tag. Enter the project, image stream, and tag of the location you would like to build from and push to.

- **Image Stream image** references an image for a given image stream and image name. Enter the image stream image you would like to build from. Also enter the project, image stream, and tag to push to.

- **Docker image**: The Docker image is referenced through a Docker image repository. You will also need to enter the project, image stream, and tag to refer to where you would like to push to.


5. Optional: In the **Environment Variables** section, add the environment variables associated with the project by using the **Name** and **Value** fields. To add more environment variables, use **Add Value**, or **Add from ConfigMap** and **Secret** .

6. Optional: To further customize your application, use the following advanced options:


Trigger
    Triggers a new image build when the builder image changes. Add more triggers by clicking **Add Trigger** and selecting the **Type** and **Secret**.
    Secrets
    Adds secrets for your application. Add more secrets by clicking **Add secret** and selecting the **Secret** and **Mount point**.
    Policy
    Click **Run policy** to select the build run policy. The selected policy determines the order in which builds created from the build configuration must run.
    Hooks
    Select **Run build hooks after image is built** to run commands at the end of the build and verify the image. Add **Hook type**, **Command**, and **Arguments** to append to the command.


7. Click **Save** to save the `BuildConfig`.


### 7.4. Deleting a BuildConfig

You can delete a `BuildConfig` using the following command.


**Procedure**

- To delete a `BuildConfig`, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc delete bc <BuildConfigName>
```



```shell-session
$ oc delete bc <BuildConfigName>
```



This also deletes all builds that were instantiated from this `BuildConfig`.


- To delete a `BuildConfig` and keep the builds instatiated from the `BuildConfig`, specify the `--cascade=false` flag when you enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc delete --cascade=false bc <BuildConfigName>
```



```shell-session
$ oc delete --cascade=false bc <BuildConfigName>
```


### 7.5. Viewing build details

You can view build details with the web console or by using the `oc describe` CLI command.


This displays information including:


- The build source.

- The build strategy.

- The output destination.

- Digest of the image in the destination registry.

- How the build was created.


If the build uses the `Docker` or `Source` strategy, the `oc describe` output also includes information about the source revision used for the build, including the commit ID, author, committer, and message.


**Procedure**

- To view build details, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc describe build <build_name>
```



```shell-session
$ oc describe build <build_name>
```


### 7.6. Accessing build logs

You can access build logs using the web console or the CLI.


**Procedure**

- To stream the logs using the build directly, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc describe build <build_name>
```



```shell-session
$ oc describe build <build_name>
```


#### 7.6.1. Accessing BuildConfig logs

You can access `BuildConfig` logs using the web console or the CLI.


**Procedure**

- To stream the logs of the latest build for a `BuildConfig`, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc logs -f bc/<buildconfig_name>
```



```shell-session
$ oc logs -f bc/<buildconfig_name>
```


#### 7.6.2. Accessing BuildConfig logs for a given version build

You can access logs for a given version build for a `BuildConfig` using the web console or the CLI.


**Procedure**

- To stream the logs for a given version build for a `BuildConfig`, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc logs --version=<number> bc/<buildconfig_name>
```



```shell-session
$ oc logs --version=<number> bc/<buildconfig_name>
```


#### 7.6.3. Enabling log verbosity

You can enable a more verbose output by passing the `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` environment variable as part of the `sourceStrategy` or `dockerStrategy` in a `BuildConfig`.


Note

An administrator can set the default build verbosity for the entire OpenShift Container Platform instance by configuring `env/BUILD_LOGLEVEL`. This default can be overridden by specifying `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` in a given `BuildConfig`. You can specify a higher priority override on the command line for non-binary builds by passing `--build-loglevel` to `oc start-build`.


Available log levels for source builds are as follows:


|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Level 0 | Produces output from containers running the `assemble` script and all encountered errors. This is the default. |
| Level 1 | Produces basic information about the executed process. |
| Level 2 | Produces very detailed information about the executed process. |
| Level 3 | Produces very detailed information about the executed process, and a listing of the archive contents. |
| Level 4 | Currently produces the same information as level 3. |
| Level 5 | Produces everything mentioned on previous levels and additionally provides docker push messages. |

**Procedure**

- To enable more verbose output, pass the `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` environment variable as part of the `sourceStrategy` or `dockerStrategy` in a `BuildConfig`:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
sourceStrategy:
...
    env:
    - name: "BUILD_LOGLEVEL"
      value: "2"
```

```yaml
sourceStrategy:
...
env:
    - name: "BUILD_LOGLEVEL"
      value: "2"
```

1

```yaml

```

[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO22-1)

Adjust this value to the desired log level.


## Chapter 8. Triggering and modifying builds

The following sections outline how to trigger builds and modify builds using build hooks.


### 8.1. Build triggers

When defining a `BuildConfig`, you can define triggers to control the circumstances in which the `BuildConfig` should be run. The following build triggers are available:


- Webhook

- Image change

- Configuration change


#### 8.1.1. Webhook triggers

Webhook triggers allow you to trigger a new build by sending a request to the OpenShift Container Platform API endpoint. You can define these triggers using GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Generic webhooks.


Currently, OpenShift Container Platform webhooks only support the analogous versions of the push event for each of the Git-based Source Code Management (SCM) systems. All other event types are ignored.


When the push events are processed, the OpenShift Container Platform control plane host confirms if the branch reference inside the event matches the branch reference in the corresponding `BuildConfig`. If so, it then checks out the exact commit reference noted in the webhook event on the OpenShift Container Platform build. If they do not match, no build is triggered.


Note

`oc new-app` and `oc new-build` create GitHub and Generic webhook triggers automatically, but any other needed webhook triggers must be added manually. You can manually add triggers by setting triggers.


For all webhooks, you must define a secret with a key named `WebHookSecretKey` and the value being the value to be supplied when invoking the webhook. The webhook definition must then reference the secret. The secret ensures the uniqueness of the URL, preventing others from triggering the build. The value of the key is compared to the secret provided during the webhook invocation.


For example here is a GitHub webhook with a reference to a secret named `mysecret`:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
type: "GitHub"
github:
secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
```

```yaml
type: "GitHub"
github:
secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
```

The secret is then defined as follows. Note that the value of the secret is base64 encoded as is required for any `data` field of a `Secret` object.


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
- kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
    name: mysecret
    creationTimestamp:
data:
    WebHookSecretKey: c2VjcmV0dmFsdWUx
```

```yaml
- kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
    name: mysecret
    creationTimestamp:
data:
    WebHookSecretKey: c2VjcmV0dmFsdWUx
```

##### 8.1.1.1. Adding unauthenticated users to the system:webhook role binding

As a cluster administrator, you can add unauthenticated users to the `system:webhook` role binding in OpenShift Container Platform for specific namespaces. The `system:webhook` role binding allows users to trigger builds from external systems that do not use an OpenShift Container Platform authentication mechanism. Unauthenticated users do not have access to non-public role bindings by default. This is a change from OpenShift Container Platform versions before 4.16.


Adding unauthenticated users to the `system:webhook` role binding is required to successfully trigger builds from GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.


If it is necessary to allow unauthenticated users access to a cluster, you can do so by adding unauthenticated users to the `system:webhook` role binding in each required namespace. This method is more secure than adding unauthenticated users to the `system:webhook` cluster role binding. However, if you have a large number of namespaces, it is possible to add unauthenticated users to the `system:webhook` cluster role binding which would apply the change to all namespaces.


Important

Always verify compliance with your organization’s security standards when modifying unauthenticated access.


**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI ( `oc`).


**Procedure**

1. Create a YAML file named `add-webhooks-unauth.yaml` and add the following content:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
     annotations:
       rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "true"
     name: webhook-access-unauthenticated
     namespace: <namespace>
roleRef:
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
     kind: Role
     name: "system:webhook"
subjects:
  - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: Group
    name: "system:unauthenticated"
```

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
annotations:
    rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "true"
name: webhook-access-unauthenticated
namespace: <namespace>
```

1

```yaml

roleRef:
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
kind: Role
name: "system:webhook"
subjects:
  - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: Group
    name: "system:unauthenticated"
```

[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO23-1)

The namespace of your `BuildConfig`.


2. Apply the configuration by running the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc apply -f add-webhooks-unauth.yaml
```



```shell-session
$ oc apply -f add-webhooks-unauth.yaml
```


**Additional resources**

- [Cluster role bindings for unauthenticated groups](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/authentication_and_authorization/#unauthenticated-users-cluster-role-bindings-concept_using-rbac)

##### 8.1.1.2. Using GitHub webhooks

GitHub webhooks handle the call made by GitHub when a repository is updated. When defining the trigger, you must specify a secret, which is part of the URL you supply to GitHub when configuring the webhook.


Example GitHub webhook definition:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
type: "GitHub"
github:
secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
```

```yaml
type: "GitHub"
github:
secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
```

Note

The secret used in the webhook trigger configuration is not the same as the `secret` field you encounter when configuring webhook in GitHub UI. The secret in the webhook trigger configuration makes the webhook URL unique and hard to predict. The secret configured in the GitHub UI is an optional string field that is used to create an HMAC hex digest of the body, which is sent as an `X-Hub-Signature` header.


The payload URL is returned as the GitHub Webhook URL by the `oc describe` command (see Displaying Webhook URLs), and is structured as follows:


**Example output**

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/github
```

```shell-session
https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/github
```

**Prerequisites**

- Create a `BuildConfig` from a GitHub repository.

- `system:unauthenticated` has access to the `system:webhook` role in the required namespaces. Or, `system:unauthenticated` has access to the `system:webhook` cluster role.


**Procedure**

1. Configure a GitHub Webhook.




1. After creating a `BuildConfig` object from a GitHub repository, run the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc describe bc/<name_of_your_BuildConfig>
```



```shell-session
$ oc describe bc/<name_of_your_BuildConfig>
```



    This command generates a webhook GitHub URL.




**Example output**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
https://api.starter-us-east-1.openshift.com:443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/github
```



```shell-session
https://api.starter-us-east-1.openshift.com:443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/github
```

2. Cut and paste this URL into GitHub, from the GitHub web console.

3. In your GitHub repository, select **Add Webhook** from **Settings → Webhooks**.

4. Paste the URL output into the **Payload URL** field.

5. Change the **Content Type** from GitHub’s default `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` to `application/json`.

6. Click **Add webhook**.



    You should see a message from GitHub stating that your webhook was successfully configured.



    Now, when you push a change to your GitHub repository, a new build automatically starts, and upon a successful build a new deployment starts.



Note





[Gogs](https://gogs.io/) supports the same webhook payload format as GitHub. Therefore, if you are using a Gogs server, you can define a GitHub webhook trigger on your `BuildConfig` and trigger it by your Gogs server as well.



2. Given a file containing a valid JSON payload, such as `payload.json`, you can manually trigger the webhook with the following `curl` command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
curl -H "X-GitHub-Event: push" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k -X POST --data-binary @payload.json https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/github
```



```shell-session
$ curl -H "X-GitHub-Event: push" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k -X POST --data-binary @payload.json https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/github
```



    The `-k` argument is only necessary if your API server does not have a properly signed certificate.



Note

The build will only be triggered if the `ref` value from GitHub webhook event matches the `ref` value specified in the `source.git` field of the `BuildConfig` resource.


**Additional resources**

- [Gogs](https://gogs.io/)

##### 8.1.1.3. Using GitLab webhooks

GitLab webhooks handle the call made by GitLab when a repository is updated. As with the GitHub triggers, you must specify a secret. The following example is a trigger definition YAML within the `BuildConfig`:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
type: "GitLab"
gitlab:
secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
```

```yaml
type: "GitLab"
gitlab:
secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
```

The payload URL is returned as the GitLab Webhook URL by the `oc describe` command, and is structured as follows:


**Example output**

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/gitlab
```

```shell-session
https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/gitlab
```

**Prerequisites**

- `system:unauthenticated` has access to the `system:webhook` role in the required namespaces. Or, `system:unauthenticated` has access to the `system:webhook` cluster role.


**Procedure**

1. Configure a GitLab Webhook.




1. Get the webhook URL by entering the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc describe bc <name>
```



```shell-session
$ oc describe bc <name>
```

2. Copy the webhook URL, replacing `<secret>` with your secret value.

3. Follow the [GitLab setup instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#webhooks) to paste the webhook URL into your GitLab repository settings.


2. Given a file containing a valid JSON payload, such as `payload.json`, you can manually trigger the webhook with the following `curl` command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
curl -H "X-GitLab-Event: Push Hook" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k -X POST --data-binary @payload.json https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/gitlab
```



```shell-session
$ curl -H "X-GitLab-Event: Push Hook" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k -X POST --data-binary @payload.json https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/gitlab
```



    The `-k` argument is only necessary if your API server does not have a properly signed certificate.



##### 8.1.1.4. Using Bitbucket webhooks

[Bitbucket webhooks](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/manage-webhooks-735643732.html) handle the call made by Bitbucket when a repository is updated. Similar to GitHub and GitLab triggers, you must specify a secret. The following example is a trigger definition YAML within the `BuildConfig`:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
type: "Bitbucket"
bitbucket:
secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
```

```yaml
type: "Bitbucket"
bitbucket:
secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
```

The payload URL is returned as the Bitbucket Webhook URL by the `oc describe` command, and is structured as follows:


**Example output**

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/bitbucket
```

```shell-session
https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/bitbucket
```

**Prerequisites**

- `system:unauthenticated` has access to the `system:webhook` role in the required namespaces. Or, `system:unauthenticated` has access to the `system:webhook` cluster role.


**Procedure**

1. Configure a Bitbucket Webhook.




1. Get the webhook URL by entering the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc describe bc <name>
```



```shell-session
$ oc describe bc <name>
```

2. Copy the webhook URL, replacing `<secret>` with your secret value.

3. Follow the [Bitbucket setup instructions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/manage-webhooks-735643732.html) to paste the webhook URL into your Bitbucket repository settings.


2. Given a file containing a valid JSON payload, such as `payload.json`, you can manually trigger the webhook by entering the following `curl` command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
curl -H "X-Event-Key: repo:push" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k -X POST --data-binary @payload.json https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/bitbucket
```



```shell-session
$ curl -H "X-Event-Key: repo:push" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k -X POST --data-binary @payload.json https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/bitbucket
```



    The `-k` argument is only necessary if your API server does not have a properly signed certificate.



##### 8.1.1.5. Using generic webhooks

Generic webhooks are called from any system capable of making a web request. As with the other webhooks, you must specify a secret, which is part of the URL that the caller must use to trigger the build. The secret ensures the uniqueness of the URL, preventing others from triggering the build. The following is an example trigger definition YAML within the `BuildConfig`:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
type: "Generic"
generic:
secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
allowEnv: true
```

```yaml
type: "Generic"
generic:
secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
allowEnv: true
```

1

```yaml

```

[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO24-1)

Set to `true` to allow a generic webhook to pass in environment variables.


**Procedure**

1. To set up the caller, supply the calling system with the URL of the generic webhook endpoint for your build.




**Example generic webhook endpoint URL**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/generic
```



```plaintext
https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/generic
```








    The caller must call the webhook as a `POST` operation.


2. To call the webhook manually, enter the following `curl` command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
curl -X POST -k https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/generic
```



```shell-session
$ curl -X POST -k https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/generic
```



    The HTTP verb must be set to `POST`. The insecure `-k` flag is specified to ignore certificate validation. This second flag is not necessary if your cluster has properly signed certificates.



    The endpoint can accept an optional payload with the following format:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
git:
     uri: "<url to git repository>"
     ref: "<optional git reference>"
     commit: "<commit hash identifying a specific git commit>"
     author:
       name: "<author name>"
       email: "<author e-mail>"
     committer:
       name: "<committer name>"
       email: "<committer e-mail>"
     message: "<commit message>"
env:
   - name: "<variable name>"
     value: "<variable value>"
```

```yaml
git:
uri: "<url to git repository>"
ref: "<optional git reference>"
commit: "<commit hash identifying a specific git commit>"
author:
    name: "<author name>"
    email: "<author e-mail>"
committer:
    name: "<committer name>"
    email: "<committer e-mail>"
message: "<commit message>"
env:
```

1

```yaml

   - name: "<variable name>"
     value: "<variable value>"
```

[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO25-1)

Similar to the `BuildConfig` environment variables, the environment variables defined here are made available to your build. If these variables collide with the `BuildConfig` environment variables, these variables take precedence. By default, environment variables passed by webhook are ignored. Set the `allowEnv` field to `true` on the webhook definition to enable this behavior.


3. To pass this payload using `curl`, define it in a file named `payload_file.yaml` and run the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/yaml" --data-binary @payload_file.yaml -X POST -k https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/generic
```



```shell-session
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/yaml" --data-binary @payload_file.yaml -X POST -k https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/generic
```



    The arguments are the same as the previous example with the addition of a header and a payload. The `-H` argument sets the `Content-Type` header to `application/yaml` or `application/json` depending on your payload format. The `--data-binary` argument is used to send a binary payload with newlines intact with the `POST` request.



Note

OpenShift Container Platform permits builds to be triggered by the generic webhook even if an invalid request payload is presented, for example, invalid content type, unparsable or invalid content, and so on. This behavior is maintained for backwards compatibility. If an invalid request payload is presented, OpenShift Container Platform returns a warning in JSON format as part of its `HTTP 200 OK` response.


##### 8.1.1.6. Displaying webhook URLs

You can use the `oc describe` command to display webhook URLs associated with a build configuration. If the command does not display any webhook URLs, then no webhook trigger is currently defined for that build configuration.


**Procedure**

- To display any webhook URLs associated with a `BuildConfig`, run the following command:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc describe bc <name>
```

```shell-session
$ oc describe bc <name>
```

#### 8.1.2. Using image change triggers

As a developer, you can configure your build to run automatically every time a base image changes.


You can use image change triggers to automatically invoke your build when a new version of an upstream image is available. For example, if a build is based on a RHEL image, you can trigger that build to run any time the RHEL image changes. As a result, the application image is always running on the latest RHEL base image.


Note

Image streams that point to container images in [v1 container registries](http://docs.docker.com/v1.7/reference/api/hub_registry_spec/#docker-registry-1-0) only trigger a build once when the image stream tag becomes available and not on subsequent image updates. This is due to the lack of uniquely identifiable images in v1 container registries.


**Procedure**

1. Define an `ImageStream` that points to the upstream image you want to use as a trigger:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
kind: "ImageStream"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
     name: "ruby-20-centos7"
```



```yaml
kind: "ImageStream"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
     name: "ruby-20-centos7"
```



    This defines the image stream that is tied to a container image repository located at `<system-registry>/<namespace>/ruby-20-centos7`. The `<system-registry>` is defined as a service with the name `docker-registry` running in OpenShift Container Platform.


2. If an image stream is the base image for the build, set the `from` field in the build strategy to point to the `ImageStream`:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
strategy:
     sourceStrategy:
       from:
         kind: "ImageStreamTag"
         name: "ruby-20-centos7:latest"
```



```yaml
strategy:
     sourceStrategy:
       from:
         kind: "ImageStreamTag"
         name: "ruby-20-centos7:latest"
```



    In this case, the `sourceStrategy` definition is consuming the `latest` tag of the image stream named `ruby-20-centos7` located within this namespace.


3. Define a build with one or more triggers that point to `ImageStreams`:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
type: "ImageChange"
imageChange: {}
type: "ImageChange"
imageChange:
     from:
       kind: "ImageStreamTag"
       name: "custom-image:latest"
```



```yaml
type: "ImageChange"
```

1

```yaml

imageChange: {}
type: "ImageChange"
```

2

```yaml

imageChange:
     from:
       kind: "ImageStreamTag"
       name: "custom-image:latest"
```


[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO26-1)


An image change trigger that monitors the `ImageStream` and `Tag` as defined by the build strategy’s `from` field. The `imageChange` object here must be empty.


[2](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO26-2)


An image change trigger that monitors an arbitrary image stream. The `imageChange` part, in this case, must include a `from` field that references the `ImageStreamTag` to monitor.



When using an image change trigger for the strategy image stream, the generated build is supplied with an immutable docker tag that points to the latest image corresponding to that tag. This new image reference is used by the strategy when it executes for the build.


For other image change triggers that do not reference the strategy image stream, a new build is started, but the build strategy is not updated with a unique image reference.


Since this example has an image change trigger for the strategy, the resulting build is:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
strategy:
sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "DockerImage"
      name: "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos7:<immutableid>"
```

```yaml
strategy:
sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "DockerImage"
      name: "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos7:<immutableid>"
```

This ensures that the triggered build uses the new image that was just pushed to the repository, and the build can be re-run any time with the same inputs.


You can pause an image change trigger to allow multiple changes on the referenced image stream before a build is started. You can also set the `paused` attribute to true when initially adding an `ImageChangeTrigger` to a `BuildConfig` to prevent a build from being immediately triggered.


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
type: "ImageChange"
imageChange:
from:
    kind: "ImageStreamTag"
    name: "custom-image:latest"
paused: true
```

```yaml
type: "ImageChange"
imageChange:
from:
    kind: "ImageStreamTag"
    name: "custom-image:latest"
paused: true
```

In addition to setting the image field for all `Strategy` types, for custom builds, the `OPENSHIFT_CUSTOM_BUILD_BASE_IMAGE` environment variable is checked. If it does not exist, then it is created with the immutable image reference. If it does exist, then it is updated with the immutable image reference.


If a build is triggered due to a webhook trigger or manual request, the build that is created uses the `<immutableid>` resolved from the `ImageStream` referenced by the `Strategy`. This ensures that builds are performed using consistent image tags for ease of reproduction.

#### 8.1.3. Identifying the image change trigger of a build

As a developer, if you have image change triggers, you can identify which image change initiated the last build. This can be useful for debugging or troubleshooting builds.


**Example `BuildConfig`**

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
name: bc-ict-example
namespace: bc-ict-example-namespace
spec:

# ...

triggers:
  - imageChange:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: input:latest
        namespace: bc-ict-example-namespace
  - imageChange:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: input2:latest
        namespace: bc-ict-example-namespace
    type: ImageChange
status:

  - from:
      name: input2:latest
      namespace: bc-ict-example-namespace
    lastTriggeredImageID:  image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/bc-ict-example-namespace/input2@sha256:0f88ffbeb9d25525720bfa3524cb2ce0908b7f791057cf1acfae917b11266a69

lastVersion: 1
```

```yaml
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
kind: BuildConfig

        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: input:latest
        namespace: bc-ict-example-namespace
  - imageChange:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag

    lastTriggeredImageID: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/bc-ict-example-namespace/input@sha256:0f88ffbeb9d25525720bfa3524cb1bf0908b7f791057cf1acfae917b11266a69
  - from:
      name: input2:latest
      namespace: bc-ict-example-namespace
    lastTriggeredImageID:  image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/bc-ict-example-namespace/input2@sha256:0f88ffbeb9d25525720bfa3524cb2ce0908b7f791057cf1acfae917b11266a69

lastVersion: 1
```

Note

This example omits elements that are not related to image change triggers.


**Prerequisites**

- You have configured multiple image change triggers. These triggers have triggered one or more builds.


**Procedure**

1. In the `BuildConfig` CR, in `status.imageChangeTriggers`, identify the `lastTriggerTime` that has the latest timestamp.



    This `ImageChangeTriggerStatus`
Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
Then you use the `name` and `namespace` from that build to find the corresponding image change trigger in `buildConfig.spec.triggers`.
```



```plaintext
Then you use the `name` and `namespace` from that build to find the corresponding image change trigger in `buildConfig.spec.triggers`.
```

2. Under `imageChangeTriggers`, compare timestamps to identify the latest


**Image change triggers**

In your build configuration, `buildConfig.spec.triggers` is an array of build trigger policies, `BuildTriggerPolicy`.


Each `BuildTriggerPolicy` has a `type` field and set of pointers fields. Each pointer field corresponds to one of the allowed values for the `type` field. As such, you can only set `BuildTriggerPolicy` to only one pointer field.


For image change triggers, the value of `type` is `ImageChange`. Then, the `imageChange` field is the pointer to an `ImageChangeTrigger` object, which has the following fields:


- `lastTriggeredImageID`: This field, which is not shown in the example, is deprecated in OpenShift Container Platform 4.8 and will be ignored in a future release. It contains the resolved image reference for the `ImageStreamTag` when the last build was triggered from this `BuildConfig`.

- `paused`: You can use this field, which is not shown in the example, to temporarily disable this particular image change trigger.

- `from`: Use this field to reference the `ImageStreamTag` that drives this image change trigger. Its type is the core Kubernetes type, `OwnerReference`.


The `from` field has the following fields of note:


- `kind`: For image change triggers, the only supported value is `ImageStreamTag`.

- `namespace`: Use this field to specify the namespace of the `ImageStreamTag`.

- `name`: Use this field to specify the `ImageStreamTag`.


**Image change trigger status**

In your build configuration, `buildConfig.status.imageChangeTriggers` is an array of `ImageChangeTriggerStatus` elements. Each `ImageChangeTriggerStatus` element includes the `from`, `lastTriggeredImageID`, and `lastTriggerTime` elements shown in the preceding example.


The `ImageChangeTriggerStatus` that has the most recent `lastTriggerTime` triggered the most recent build. You use its `name` and `namespace` to identify the image change trigger in `buildConfig.spec.triggers` that triggered the build.


The `lastTriggerTime` with the most recent timestamp signifies the `ImageChangeTriggerStatus` of the last build. This `ImageChangeTriggerStatus` has the same `name` and `namespace` as the image change trigger in `buildConfig.spec.triggers` that triggered the build.

#### 8.1.4. Configuration change triggers

A configuration change trigger allows a build to be automatically invoked as soon as a new `BuildConfig` is created.


The following is an example trigger definition YAML within the `BuildConfig`:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
type: "ConfigChange"
```

```yaml
type: "ConfigChange"
```

Note

Configuration change triggers currently only work when creating a new `BuildConfig`. In a future release, configuration change triggers will also be able to launch a build whenever a `BuildConfig` is updated.


##### 8.1.4.1. Setting triggers manually

Triggers can be added to and removed from build configurations with `oc set triggers`.


**Procedure**

- To set a GitHub webhook trigger on a build configuration, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc set triggers bc <name> --from-github
```



```shell-session
$ oc set triggers bc <name> --from-github
```

- To set an image change trigger, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc set triggers bc <name> --from-image='<image>'
```



```shell-session
$ oc set triggers bc <name> --from-image='<image>'
```

- To remove a trigger, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc set triggers bc <name> --from-bitbucket --remove
```



```shell-session
$ oc set triggers bc <name> --from-bitbucket --remove
```


Note

When a webhook trigger already exists, adding it again regenerates the webhook secret.


For more information, consult the help documentation by entering the following command:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc set triggers --help
```

```shell-session
$ oc set triggers --help
```

### 8.2. Build hooks

Build hooks allow behavior to be injected into the build process.


The `postCommit` field of a `BuildConfig` object runs commands inside a temporary container that is running the build output image. The hook is run immediately after the last layer of the image has been committed and before the image is pushed to a registry.


The current working directory is set to the image’s `WORKDIR`, which is the default working directory of the container image. For most images, this is where the source code is located.


The hook fails if the script or command returns a non-zero exit code or if starting the temporary container fails. When the hook fails it marks the build as failed and the image is not pushed to a registry. The reason for failing can be inspected by looking at the build logs.


Build hooks can be used to run unit tests to verify the image before the build is marked complete and the image is made available in a registry. If all tests pass and the test runner returns with exit code `0`, the build is marked successful. In case of any test failure, the build is marked as failed. In all cases, the build log contains the output of the test runner, which can be used to identify failed tests.


The `postCommit` hook is not only limited to running tests, but can be used for other commands as well. Since it runs in a temporary container, changes made by the hook do not persist, meaning that running the hook cannot affect the final image. This behavior allows for, among other uses, the installation and usage of test dependencies that are automatically discarded and are not present in the final image.


#### 8.2.1. Configuring post commit build hooks

There are different ways to configure the post-build hook. All forms in the following examples are equivalent and run `bundle exec rake test --verbose`.


**Procedure**

- Use one of the following options to configure post-build hooks:




| Option | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Shell script | Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow<br>```<br>postCommit:<br>  script: "bundle exec rake test --verbose"<br>```<br>```yaml<br>postCommit:<br>  script: "bundle exec rake test --verbose"<br>```<br>The `script` value is a shell script to be run with `/bin/sh -ic`. Use this option when a shell script is appropriate to execute the build hook. For example, for running unit tests as above. To control the image entry point or if the image does not have `/bin/sh`, use `command`, or `args`, or both.<br> <br>Note<br>The additional `-i` flag was introduced to improve the experience working with CentOS and RHEL images, and may be removed in a future release. |
| Command as the image entry point | Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow<br>```<br>postCommit:<br>  command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "bundle exec rake test --verbose"]<br>```<br>```yaml<br>postCommit:<br>  command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "bundle exec rake test --verbose"]<br>```<br>In this form, `command` is the command to run, which overrides the image entry point in the exec form, as documented in the [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint). This is needed if the image does not have `/bin/sh`, or if you do not want to use a shell. In all other cases, using `script` might be more convenient. |
| Command with arguments | Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow<br>```<br>postCommit:<br>  command: ["bundle", "exec", "rake", "test"]<br>  args: ["--verbose"]<br>```<br>```yaml<br>postCommit:<br>  command: ["bundle", "exec", "rake", "test"]<br>  args: ["--verbose"]<br>```<br>This form is equivalent to appending the arguments to `command`. |


Note

Providing both `script` and `command` simultaneously creates an invalid build hook.


#### 8.2.2. Using the CLI to set post commit build hooks

The `oc set build-hook` command can be used to set the build hook for a build configuration.


**Procedure**

1. Complete one of the following actions:




- To set a command as the post-commit build hook, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc set build-hook bc/mybc \
      --post-commit \
      --command \
      -- bundle exec rake test --verbose
```



```shell-session
$ oc set build-hook bc/mybc \
      --post-commit \
      --command \
      -- bundle exec rake test --verbose
```

- To set a script as the post-commit build hook, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc set build-hook bc/mybc --post-commit --script="bundle exec rake test --verbose"
```



```shell-session
$ oc set build-hook bc/mybc --post-commit --script="bundle exec rake test --verbose"
```


## Chapter 9. Performing advanced builds

You can set build resources and maximum duration, assign builds to nodes, chain builds, prune builds, and configure build run policies.


### 9.1. Setting build resources

By default, builds are completed by pods using unbound resources, such as memory and CPU. These resources can be limited.


**Procedure**

You can limit resource use in two ways:


- Limit resource use by specifying resource limits in the default container limits of a project.

- Limit resource use by specifying resource limits as part of the build configuration.




- In the following example, each of the `resources`, `cpu`, and `memory` parameters are optional:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "BuildConfig"
metadata:
    name: "sample-build"
spec:
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "100m"
        memory: "256Mi"
```



```yaml
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "BuildConfig"
metadata:
    name: "sample-build"
spec:
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "100m"
```

1

```yaml

        memory: "256Mi"
```

2

```yaml

```


[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO27-1)

`cpu` is in CPU units: `100m` represents 0.1 CPU units (100 \* 1e-3).


[2](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO27-2)

`memory` is in bytes: `256Mi` represents 268435456 bytes (256 \* 2 ^ 20).





However, if a quota has been defined for your project, one of the following two items is required:




- A `resources` section set with an explicit `requests`:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "100m"
      memory: "256Mi"
```



```yaml
resources:
    requests:
```

1

```yaml

      cpu: "100m"
      memory: "256Mi"
```


[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO28-1)


The `requests` object contains the list of resources that correspond to the list of resources in the quota.


- A limit range defined in your project, where the defaults from the `LimitRange` object apply to pods created during the build process.



Otherwise, build pod creation will fail, citing a failure to satisfy quota.



### 9.2. Setting maximum duration

When defining a `BuildConfig` object, you can define its maximum duration by setting the `completionDeadlineSeconds` field. It is specified in seconds and is not set by default. When not set, there is no maximum duration enforced.


The maximum duration is counted from the time when a build pod gets scheduled in the system, and defines how long it can be active, including the time needed to pull the builder image. After reaching the specified timeout, the build is terminated by OpenShift Container Platform.


**Procedure**

- To set maximum duration, specify `completionDeadlineSeconds` in your `BuildConfig`. The following example shows the part of a `BuildConfig` specifying `completionDeadlineSeconds` field for 30 minutes:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
spec:
    completionDeadlineSeconds: 1800
```



```yaml
spec:
    completionDeadlineSeconds: 1800
```


Note

This setting is not supported with the Pipeline Strategy option.


### 9.3. Assigning builds to specific nodes

Builds can be targeted to run on specific nodes by specifying labels in the `nodeSelector` field of a build configuration. The `nodeSelector` value is a set of key-value pairs that are matched to `Node` labels when scheduling the build pod.


The `nodeSelector` value can also be controlled by cluster-wide default and override values. Defaults will only be applied if the build configuration does not define any key-value pairs for the `nodeSelector` and also does not define an explicitly empty map value of `nodeSelector:{}`. Override values will replace values in the build configuration on a key by key basis.


Note

If the specified `NodeSelector` cannot be matched to a node with those labels, the build still stay in the `Pending` state indefinitely.


**Procedure**

- Assign builds to run on specific nodes by assigning labels in the `nodeSelector` field of the `BuildConfig`, for example:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "BuildConfig"
metadata:
    name: "sample-build"
spec:
    nodeSelector:
      key1: value1
      key2: value2
```



```yaml
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "BuildConfig"
metadata:
    name: "sample-build"
spec:
    nodeSelector:
```

1

```yaml

      key1: value1
      key2: value2
```


[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO29-1)


Builds associated with this build configuration will run only on nodes with the `key1=value2` and `key2=value2` labels.



### 9.4. Chained builds

For compiled languages such as Go, C, C++, and Java, including the dependencies necessary for compilation in the application image might increase the size of the image or introduce vulnerabilities that can be exploited.


To avoid these problems, two builds can be chained together. One build that produces the compiled artifact, and a second build that places that artifact in a separate image that runs the artifact.


In the following example, a source-to-image (S2I) build is combined with a docker build to compile an artifact that is then placed in a separate runtime image.


Note

Although this example chains a S2I build and a docker build, the first build can use any strategy that produces an image containing the desired artifacts, and the second build can use any strategy that can consume input content from an image.


The first build takes the application source and produces an image containing a `WAR` file. The image is pushed to the `artifact-image` image stream. The path of the output artifact depends on the `assemble` script of the S2I builder used. In this case, it is output to `/wildfly/standalone/deployments/ROOT.war`.

metadata:
name: artifact-build

    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: artifact-image:latest

    git:
      uri: https://github.com/openshift/openshift-jee-sample.git
      ref: "master"
strategy:
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: wildfly:10.1
        namespace: openshift
```

```yaml
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1

    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: wildfly:10.1
        namespace: openshift
```

The second build uses image source with a path to the WAR file inside the output image from the first build. An inline `dockerfile` copies that `WAR` file into a runtime image.

      from:
```

```yaml

        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: jee-runtime:latest
triggers:
  - imageChange: {}
    type: ImageChange
```

[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO30-1)

`from` specifies that the docker build should include the output of the image from the `artifact-image` image stream, which was the target of the previous build.


[2](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO30-2)

`paths` specifies which paths from the target image to include in the current docker build.


[3](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO30-3)

The runtime image is used as the source image for the docker build.


The result of this setup is that the output image of the second build does not have to contain any of the build tools that are needed to create the `WAR` file. Also, because the second build contains an image change trigger, whenever the first build is run and produces a new image with the binary artifact, the second build is automatically triggered to produce a runtime image that contains that artifact. Therefore, both builds behave as a single build with two stages.


### 9.5. Pruning builds

By default, builds that have completed their lifecycle are persisted indefinitely. You can limit the number of previous builds that are retained.


**Procedure**

1. Limit the number of previous builds that are retained by supplying a positive integer value for `successfulBuildsHistoryLimit` or `failedBuildsHistoryLimit` in your `BuildConfig`, for example:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "BuildConfig"
metadata:
     name: "sample-build"
spec:
     successfulBuildsHistoryLimit: 2
     failedBuildsHistoryLimit: 2
```



```yaml
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "BuildConfig"
metadata:
     name: "sample-build"
spec:
     successfulBuildsHistoryLimit: 2
```

1

```yaml

     failedBuildsHistoryLimit: 2
```

2

```yaml

```


[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO31-1)

`successfulBuildsHistoryLimit` will retain up to two builds with a status of `completed`.


[2](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO31-2)

`failedBuildsHistoryLimit` will retain up to two builds with a status of `failed`, `canceled`, or `error`.


2. Trigger build pruning by one of the following actions:




- Updating a build configuration.

- Waiting for a build to complete its lifecycle.


Builds are sorted by their creation timestamp with the oldest builds being pruned first.


Note

Administrators can manually prune builds using the 'oc adm' object pruning command.


### 9.6. Build run policy

The build run policy describes the order in which the builds created from the build configuration should run. This can be done by changing the value of the `runPolicy` field in the `spec` section of the `Build` specification.


It is also possible to change the `runPolicy` value for existing build configurations, by:


- Changing `Parallel` to `Serial` or `SerialLatestOnly` and triggering a new build from this configuration causes the new build to wait until all parallel builds complete as the serial build can only run alone.

- Changing `Serial` to `SerialLatestOnly` and triggering a new build causes cancellation of all existing builds in queue, except the currently running build and the most recently created build. The newest build runs next.


## Chapter 10. Using Red Hat subscriptions in builds

Use the following sections to install Red Hat subscription content within OpenShift Container Platform builds.


### 10.1. Creating an image stream tag for the Red Hat Universal Base Image

To install Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) packages within a build, you can create an image stream tag to reference the Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI).


To make the UBI available **in every project** in the cluster, add the image stream tag to the `openshift` namespace. Otherwise, to make it available **in a specific project**, add the image stream tag to that project.


Image stream tags grant access to the UBI by using the `registry.redhat.io` credentials that are present in the install pull secret, without exposing the pull secret to other users. This method is more convenient than requiring each developer to install pull secrets with `registry.redhat.io` credentials in each project.


**Procedure**

- To create an `ImageStreamTag` resource in the `openshift` namespace, so it is available to developers in all projects, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc tag --source=docker registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest ubi9:latest -n openshift
```



```shell-session
$ oc tag --source=docker registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest ubi9:latest -n openshift
```



Tip






You can alternatively apply the following YAML to create an `ImageStreamTag` resource in the `openshift` namespace:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
    name: ubi9
    namespace: openshift
spec:
    tags:
  - from:
      kind: DockerImage
      name: registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest
    name: latest
    referencePolicy:
      type: Source
```

```yaml
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
name: ubi9
namespace: openshift
spec:
tags:
  - from:
      kind: DockerImage
      name: registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest
    name: latest
    referencePolicy:
      type: Source
```

- To create an `ImageStreamTag` resource in a single project, enter the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc tag --source=docker registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest ubi:latest
```



```shell-session
$ oc tag --source=docker registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest ubi:latest

    name: latest
    referencePolicy:
      type: Source
```

### 10.2. Adding subscription entitlements as a build secret

Builds that use Red Hat subscriptions to install content must include the entitlement keys as a build secret.


**Prerequisites**

- You must have access to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) package repositories through your subscription. The entitlement secret to access these repositories is automatically created by the Insights Operator when your cluster is subscribed.

- You must have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role or you have permission to access secrets in the `openshift-config-managed` project.


**Procedure**

1. Copy the entitlement secret from the `openshift-config-managed` namespace to the namespace of the build by entering the following commands:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
cat << EOF > secret-template.txt
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
     name: etc-pki-entitlement
type: Opaque
data: {{ range \$key, \$value := .data }}
     {{ \$key }}: {{ \$value }} {{ end }}
EOF
oc get secret etc-pki-entitlement -n openshift-config-managed -o=go-template-file --template=secret-template.txt | oc apply -f -
```



```shell-session
$ cat << EOF > secret-template.txt
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
     name: etc-pki-entitlement
type: Opaque
data: {{ range \$key, \$value := .data }}
     {{ \$key }}: {{ \$value }} {{ end }}
EOF
$ oc get secret etc-pki-entitlement -n openshift-config-managed -o=go-template-file --template=secret-template.txt | oc apply -f -
```

2. Add the etc-pki-entitlement secret as a build volume in the build configuration’s Docker strategy:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
strategy:
     dockerStrategy:
       from:
         kind: ImageStreamTag
         name: ubi9:latest
       volumes:
    - name: etc-pki-entitlement
      mounts:
      - destinationPath: /etc/pki/entitlement
      source:
        type: Secret
        secret:
          secretName: etc-pki-entitlement
```

```yaml
strategy:
dockerStrategy:
    from:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: ubi9:latest
    volumes:
    - name: etc-pki-entitlement
      mounts:
      - destinationPath: /etc/pki/entitlement
      source:
        type: Secret
        secret:
          secretName: etc-pki-entitlement
```

### 10.3. Running builds with Subscription Manager

#### 10.3.1. Docker builds using Subscription Manager

Docker strategy builds can use `yum` or `dnf` to install additional Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) packages.


**Prerequisites**

- The entitlement keys must be added as build strategy volumes.


**Procedure**

- Use the following as an example Dockerfile to install content with the Subscription Manager:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
FROM registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest
RUN rm -rf /etc/rhsm-host
RUN yum --enablerepo=codeready-builder-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms install \
      nss_wrapper \
      uid_wrapper -y && \
      yum clean all -y

```


[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO32-1)


You must include the command to remove the `/etc/rhsm-host` directory and all its contents in your Dockerfile before executing any `yum` or `dnf` commands.


[2](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO32-2)


Use the [Red Hat Package Browser](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/package-browser) to find the correct repositories for your installed packages.


[3](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/builds_using_buildconfig/index#CO32-3)


You must restore the `/etc/rhsm-host` symbolic link to keep your image compatible with other Red Hat container images.



### 10.4. Running builds with Red Hat Satellite subscriptions

#### 10.4.1. Adding Red Hat Satellite configurations to builds

Builds that use Red Hat Satellite to install content must provide appropriate configurations to obtain content from Satellite repositories.


**Prerequisites**

- You must provide or create a `yum`-compatible repository configuration file that downloads content from your Satellite instance.




**Sample repository configuration**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
[test-<name>]
name=test-<number>
baseurl = https://satellite.../content/dist/rhel/server/7/7Server/x86_64/os
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
sslverify=0
sslclientkey = /etc/pki/entitlement/...-key.pem
sslclientcert = /etc/pki/entitlement/....pem
```



```shell-session
[test-<name>]
name=test-<number>
baseurl = https://satellite.../content/dist/rhel/server/7/7Server/x86_64/os
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
sslverify=0
sslclientkey = /etc/pki/entitlement/...-key.pem
sslclientcert = /etc/pki/entitlement/....pem
```


**Procedure**

1. Create a `ConfigMap` object containing the Satellite repository configuration file by entering the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc create configmap yum-repos-d --from-file /path/to/satellite.repo
```



```shell-session
$ oc create configmap yum-repos-d --from-file /path/to/satellite.repo

    - name: yum-repos-d
      mounts:
      - destinationPath: /etc/yum.repos.d
      source:
        type: ConfigMap
        configMap:
          name: yum-repos-d
    - name: etc-pki-entitlement
      mounts:
      - destinationPath: /etc/pki/entitlement
      source:
        type: Secret
        secret:
          secretName: etc-pki-entitlement
```

```yaml

- [How to use builds with Red Hat Satellite subscriptions and which certificate to use](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5847331)

### 10.5. Running builds using SharedSecret objects

You can use a `SharedSecret` object to securely access the entitlement keys of a cluster in builds.


The `SharedSecret` object allows you to share and synchronize secrets across namespaces.


Important

The Shared Resource CSI Driver feature is now generally available in [Builds for Red Hat OpenShift 1.1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/builds_for_red_hat_openshift/1.1). This feature is now removed in OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 and later. To use this feature, ensure that you are using Builds for Red Hat OpenShift 1.1 or later.


**Prerequisites**

- You have enabled the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set by using the feature gates. For more information, see [Enabling features using feature gates](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/nodes/#nodes-cluster-enabling).

- You must have permission to perform the following actions:




- Create build configs and start builds.

- Discover which `SharedSecret` CR instances are available by entering the `oc get sharedsecrets` command and getting a non-empty list back.

- Determine if the `builder` service account available to you in your namespace is allowed to use the given `SharedSecret` CR instance. In other words, you can run `oc adm policy who-can use <identifier of specific SharedSecret>` to see if the `builder` service account in your namespace is listed.


Note

If neither of the last two prerequisites in this list are met, establish, or ask someone to establish, the necessary role-based access control (RBAC) so that you can discover `SharedSecret` CR instances and enable service accounts to use `SharedSecret` CR instances.


**Procedure**

1. Use `oc apply` to create a `SharedSecret` object instance with the cluster’s entitlement secret.



Important






You must have cluster administrator permissions to create `SharedSecret` objects.







**Example `oc apply -f` command with YAML `Role` object definition**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc apply -f - <<EOF
kind: SharedSecret
apiVersion: sharedresource.openshift.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
     name: etc-pki-entitlement
spec:
     secretRef:
       name: etc-pki-entitlement
       namespace: openshift-config-managed
EOF
```



```shell-session
$ oc apply -f - <<EOF
kind: SharedSecret
apiVersion: sharedresource.openshift.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
     name: etc-pki-entitlement
spec:
     secretRef:
       name: etc-pki-entitlement
       namespace: openshift-config-managed
EOF
```

2. Create a role to grant the `builder` service account permission to access the `SharedSecret` object:




**Example `oc apply -f` command**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
     name: builder-etc-pki-entitlement
     namespace: build-namespace
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - sharedresource.openshift.io
    resources:
      - sharedsecrets
    resourceNames:
      - etc-pki-entitlement
    verbs:
      - use
EOF
```

```shell-session
$ oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
name: builder-etc-pki-entitlement
namespace: build-namespace
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - sharedresource.openshift.io
    resources:
      - sharedsecrets
    resourceNames:
      - etc-pki-entitlement
    verbs:
      - use
EOF
```

3. Create a `RoleBinding` object that grants the `builder` service account permission to access the `SharedSecret` object by running the following command:




**Example `oc create rolebinding` command**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc create rolebinding builder-etc-pki-entitlement --role=builder-etc-pki-entitlement --serviceaccount=build-namespace:builder
```



```shell-session
$ oc create rolebinding builder-etc-pki-entitlement --role=builder-etc-pki-entitlement --serviceaccount=build-namespace:builder
```

4. Add the entitlement secret to your `BuildConfig` object by using a CSI volume mount:




**Example YAML `BuildConfig` object definition**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
kind: BuildConfig

## Chapter 11. Securing builds by strategy

Builds in OpenShift Container Platform are run in privileged containers. Depending on the build strategy used, if you have privileges, you can run builds to escalate their permissions on the cluster and host nodes. And as a security measure, it limits who can run builds and the strategy that is used for those builds. Custom builds are inherently less safe than source builds, because they can execute any code within a privileged container, and are disabled by default. Grant docker build permissions with caution, because a vulnerability in the Dockerfile processing logic could result in a privileges being granted on the host node.


By default, all users that can create builds are granted permission to use the docker and Source-to-image (S2I) build strategies. Users with cluster administrator privileges can enable the custom build strategy, as referenced in the restricting build strategies to a user globally section.


You can control who can build and which build strategies they can use by using an authorization policy. Each build strategy has a corresponding build subresource. A user must have permission to create a build and permission to create on the build strategy subresource to create builds using that strategy. Default roles are provided that grant the create permission on the build strategy subresource.


| Strategy | Subresource | Role |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Docker | builds/docker | system:build-strategy-docker |
| Source-to-Image | builds/source | system:build-strategy-source |
| Custom | builds/custom | system:build-strategy-custom |
| JenkinsPipeline | builds/jenkinspipeline | system:build-strategy-jenkinspipeline |

Table 11.1. Build Strategy Subresources and Roles

### 11.1. Disabling access to a build strategy globally

To prevent access to a particular build strategy globally, log in as a user with cluster administrator privileges, remove the corresponding role from the `system:authenticated` group, and apply the annotation `rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "false"` to protect them from changes between the API restarts. The following example shows disabling the docker build strategy.


**Procedure**

1. Apply the `rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate` annotation by entering the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc annotate clusterrolebinding.rbac system:build-strategy-docker-binding 'rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate=false' --overwrite
```



```shell-session
$ oc annotate clusterrolebinding.rbac system:build-strategy-docker-binding 'rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate=false' --overwrite
```

2. Remove the role by entering the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group system:build-strategy-docker system:authenticated
```



```shell-session
$ oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group system:build-strategy-docker system:authenticated
```

3. Ensure the build strategy subresources are also removed from the `admin` and `edit` user roles:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc get clusterrole admin -o yaml | grep "builds/docker"
```



```shell-session
$ oc get clusterrole admin -o yaml | grep "builds/docker"
```

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc get clusterrole edit -o yaml | grep "builds/docker"
```



```shell-session
$ oc get clusterrole edit -o yaml | grep "builds/docker"
```


### 11.2. Restricting build strategies to users globally

You can allow a set of specific users to create builds with a particular strategy.


**Procedure**

- Assign the role that corresponds to the build strategy to a specific user. For example, to add the `system:build-strategy-docker` cluster role to the user `devuser`:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user system:build-strategy-docker devuser
```



```shell-session
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user system:build-strategy-docker devuser
```



Warning






Granting a user access at the cluster level to the `builds/docker` subresource means that the user can create builds with the docker strategy in any project in which they can create builds.



### 11.3. Restricting build strategies to a user within a project

Similar to granting the build strategy role to a user globally, you can allow a set of specific users within a project to create builds with a particular strategy.


**Procedure**

- Assign the role that corresponds to the build strategy to a specific user within a project. For example, to add the `system:build-strategy-docker` role within the project `devproject` to the user `devuser`:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc adm policy add-role-to-user system:build-strategy-docker devuser -n devproject
```



```shell-session
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user system:build-strategy-docker devuser -n devproject
```

## Chapter 13. Troubleshooting builds

Use the following to troubleshoot build issues.


### 13.1. Resolving denial for access to resources

If your request for access to resources is denied:


Issue
A build fails with:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
requested access to the resource is denied
```

```shell-session
requested access to the resource is denied
```

Resolution
You have exceeded one of the image quotas set on your project. Check your current quota and verify the limits applied and storage in use:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc describe quota
```

```shell-session
$ oc describe quota
```

### 13.2. Service certificate generation failure

If your request for access to resources is denied:


Issue
If a service certificate generation fails with (service’s `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error` annotation contains):


**Example output**

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
secret/ssl-key references serviceUID 62ad25ca-d703-11e6-9d6f-0e9c0057b608, which does not match 77b6dd80-d716-11e6-9d6f-0e9c0057b60
```

```shell-session
secret/ssl-key references serviceUID 62ad25ca-d703-11e6-9d6f-0e9c0057b608, which does not match 77b6dd80-d716-11e6-9d6f-0e9c0057b60
```

Resolution

The service that generated the certificate no longer exists, or has a different `serviceUID`. You must force certificates regeneration by removing the old secret, and clearing the following annotations on the service: `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error` and `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-num`. To clear the annotations, enter the following commands:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc delete secret <secret_name>
```

```shell-session
$ oc delete secret <secret_name>
```

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc annotate service <service_name> service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-
```

```shell-session
$ oc annotate service <service_name> service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-
```

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc annotate service <service_name> service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-num-
```

```shell-session
$ oc annotate service <service_name> service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-num-
```

Note

The command removing an annotation has a `-` after the annotation name to be removed.


## Chapter 14. Setting up additional trusted certificate authorities for builds

Use the following sections to set up additional certificate authorities (CA) to be trusted by builds when pulling images from an image registry.


The procedure requires a cluster administrator to create a `ConfigMap` and add additional CAs as keys in the `ConfigMap`.


- The `ConfigMap` must be created in the `openshift-config` namespace.

- `domain` is the key in the `ConfigMap` and `value` is the PEM-encoded certificate.




- Each CA must be associated with a domain. The domain format is `hostname[..port]`.


- The `ConfigMap` name must be set in the `image.config.openshift.io/cluster` cluster scoped configuration resource’s `spec.additionalTrustedCA` field.


### 14.1. Adding certificate authorities to the cluster

You can add certificate authorities (CA) to the cluster for use when pushing and pulling images with the following procedure.


**Prerequisites**

- You must have access to the public certificates of the registry, usually a `hostname/ca.crt` file located in the `/etc/docker/certs.d/` directory.


**Procedure**

1. Create a `ConfigMap` in the `openshift-config` namespace containing the trusted certificates for the registries that use self-signed certificates. For each CA file, ensure the key in the `ConfigMap` is the hostname of the registry in the `hostname[..port]` format:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc create configmap registry-cas -n openshift-config \
   --from-file=myregistry.corp.com..5000=/etc/docker/certs.d/myregistry.corp.com:5000/ca.crt \
   --from-file=otherregistry.com=/etc/docker/certs.d/otherregistry.com/ca.crt
```



```shell-session
$ oc create configmap registry-cas -n openshift-config \
   --from-file=myregistry.corp.com..5000=/etc/docker/certs.d/myregistry.corp.com:5000/ca.crt \
   --from-file=otherregistry.com=/etc/docker/certs.d/otherregistry.com/ca.crt
```

2. Update the cluster image configuration:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc patch image.config.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"additionalTrustedCA":{"name":"registry-cas"}}}' --type=merge
```



```shell-session
$ oc patch image.config.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"additionalTrustedCA":{"name":"registry-cas"}}}' --type=merge
```
