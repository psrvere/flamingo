**Abstract**

This document provides an overview of Builds features. It also includes release notes and details about how to get support.


* * *

## Chapter 1. Overview of Builds

Builds is an extensible build framework based on the [Shipwright project](https://shipwright.io/), which you can use to build container images on an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. You can build container images from source code and Dockerfiles by using image build tools, such as Source-to-Image (S2I) and `Buildah`. You can create and apply build resources, view logs of build runs, and manage builds in your OpenShift Container Platform namespaces.


Builds includes the following capabilities:


- Standard Kubernetes-native API for building container images from source code and Dockerfiles

- Support for Source-to-Image (S2I) and `Buildah` build strategies

- Extensibility with your own custom build strategies

- Execution of builds from source code in a local directory

- Shipwright CLI for creating and viewing logs, and managing builds on the cluster

- Integrated user experience with the **Developer** perspective of the OpenShift Container Platform web console


Builds consists of the following custom resources (CRs):


- `Build`
- `BuildStrategy` and `ClusterBuildStrategy`
- `BuildRun`

### 1.1. Build resource

The `Build` resource defines the source code of your application and the location where your application images will be pushed. The following example shows a simple build that consists of a Git source, a build strategy, and an output image:

```
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: buildah-golang-build
spec:
  source:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/username/taxi
  strategy:
    name: buildah
    kind: ClusterBuildStrategy
  output:
    image: registry.mycompany.com/my-org/taxi-app:latest
```

```yaml
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: buildah-golang-build
spec:
  source:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/username/taxi
  strategy:
    name: buildah
    kind: ClusterBuildStrategy
  output:
    image: registry.mycompany.com/my-org/taxi-app:latest
```

You can also extend a `Build` resource to push your images to a private registry or use a Dockerfile.


### 1.2. BuildStrategy and ClusterBuildStrategy resources

The `BuildStrategy` and `ClusterBuildStrategy` resources define a series of steps to assemble an application. You can use the `BuildStrategy` resources within a namespace and the `ClusterBuildStrategy` resources within a cluster.


The specification of a `BuildStrategy` or `ClusterBuildStrategy` resource consists of a `steps` object. The following example shows the specification of the `buildah` cluster build strategy:


Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterBuildStrategy
metadata:
  name: buildah
spec:
  steps:
    - name: build-and-push
      image: quay.io/containers/buildah:v1.31.0
      workingDir: $(params.shp-source-root)
      command:
        - /bin/bash
       # ...
# ...
```

```yaml
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterBuildStrategy
metadata:
  name: buildah
spec:
  steps:
    - name: build-and-push
      image: quay.io/containers/buildah:v1.31.0
      workingDir: $(params.shp-source-root)
      command:
        - /bin/bash
       # ...
# ...
```

### 1.3. BuildRun resource

A `BuildRun` resource invokes a build on your cluster, similar to any cluster job or Tekton task run. The `BuildRun` resource represents a workload on your cluster, which results in a running pod. A `BuildRun` is the running instance of a build. It instantiates a build for execution with specific parameters on a cluster.


A `BuildRun` resource helps you to define the following elements:


- A unique `BuildRun` name to monitor the status of the build

- A referenced `Build` instance to use during the build

- A service account to host all secrets for the build


Each `BuildRun` resource is available within a namespace.


### 1.4. Build controller

The build controller monitors any updates in the `Build` resource and performs the following tasks:


- Validates if the referenced `Strategy` object exists in the `Build` resource.

- Validates if the specified parameters in the `Build` CR exist in the referenced build strategy. It also validates if the parameter names collide with any reserved names.

- Validates if the container registry output secret exists in the `Build` resource.

- Validates if the referenced `spec.source.git.url` endpoint URL exists in the `Build` resource.


The build run controller monitors any updates in the `Build` or `TaskRun` resource and performs the following tasks:


- Searches for any existing `TaskRun` resource and updates its parent `BuildRun` resource status.

- Retrieves the specified service account and sets it along with the output secret in the `Build` resource.

- If a `TaskRun` resource does not exist, the controller generates a new Tekton `TaskRun` resource and sets a reference to the `TaskRun` resource.

- For any subsequent updates in the `TaskRun` resource, the controller updates the parent `BuildRun` resource.


#### 1.4.1. Build validations

To avoid triggering `BuildRun` resources that will fail because of incorrect or missing dependencies or configuration settings, the build controller validates them in advance. If all validations are successful, you view a `status.reason` field named `Succeeded`. However, if any validations fail, you must check the `status.reason` and `status.message` fields to understand the root cause.


| status.reason field | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `BuildStrategyNotFound` | The referenced strategy at namespace level does not exist. |
| `ClusterBuildStrategyNotFound` | The referenced strategy at cluster level does not exist. |
| `SetOwnerReferenceFailed` | Setting owner references between a `Build` and a `BuildRun` resources failed. This status is triggered when you set the `spec.retention.atBuildDeletion` field to `true` in a build. |
| `SpecSourceSecretRefNotFound` | The secret used to authenticate to Git does not exist. |
| `SpecOutputSecretRefNotFound` | The secret used to authenticate to the container registry does not exist. |
| `SpecBuilderSecretRefNotFound` | The secret used to authenticate to the container registry does not exist. |
| `MultipleSecretRefNotFound` | Multiple secrets used for authentication are missing. |
| `RestrictedParametersInUse` | One or many defined `params` are colliding with any reserved parameters. |
| `UndefinedParameter` | The parameters are not defined in the referenced strategy. You must define those parameters in the `spec.parameters` specification in your strategy. |
| `RemoteRepositoryUnreachable` | The defined `spec.source.git.url` specification was not found. This validation only takes place for HTTP and HTTPS protocols. |
| `BuildNameInvalid` | The build name in the `metadata.name` field is invalid. You must use a valid label value for the build name. |
| `SpecEnvNameCanNotBeBlank` | Indicates that the name for a user-provided environment variable is blank. |
| `SpecEnvValueCanNotBeBlank` | Indicates that the value for a user-provided environment variable is blank. |

## Chapter 2. Build strategies

You can use a curated set of build strategies or cluster build strategies on the OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The Builds for Red Hat OpenShift Operator automatically installs these strategies for use. This automated installation of strategies helps you to quickly get started with Builds.


Builds supports the following cluster build strategies:


- `buildah`: Supported on all platforms

- `source-to-image`: Supported on the linux/amd64 platform


Note

The `buildpacks` build strategy is currently in [Developer Preview](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/devpreview). For more information, see the [buildpacks example](https://github.com/redhat-developer/openshift-builds-catalog/blob/main/clusterBuildStrategy/buildpacks/README.md).


### 2.1. Buildah

The `buildah` cluster build strategy uses a Dockerfile to build a container image and pushes it to the target registry. You must specify the Dockerfile in the `spec.paramValues` field of the `Build` CR.


You can share the `buildah` strategy across different namespaces within your cluster because the Builds for Red Hat OpenShift Operator installs the `buildah` strategy at cluster level.


You can configure the following parameters for the `buildah` strategy:


| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `build-args` | array | Key-value pair of the arguments required by the Dockerfile that is used during the build | \[\] |
| `registries-block` | array | List of registries that must be blocked | \[\] |
| `registries-insecure` | array | List of insecure registries with their fully qualified domain name (FQDN) | \[\] |
| `registries-search` | array | List of registries to search short name images | \["registry.redhat.io", "quay.io"\] |
| `dockerfile` | string | Path of the Dockerfile that is used during the build | "Dockerfile" |
| `storage-driver` | string | Storage drivers that are used by `buildah`, such as overlay or vfs | "vfs" |

Table 2.1. Configuration parameters for buildah

Note

For more information, see _Configuring build strategies_ in the _Additional resources_ section.


### 2.2. Source-to-image

This build strategy is composed of `source-to-image` and `buildah`. You can use this strategy to generate a container file and prepare the application to build with a builder image. You must specify the builder image in the `spec.paramValues` field of the `Build` CR.


You can share the `source-to-image` strategy across different namespaces within your cluster because the Builds for Red Hat OpenShift Operator installs the `source-to-image` strategy at cluster level.


You can configure the following parameters for the `source-to-image` strategy:


| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `registries-block` | array | List of registries that must be blocked | \[\] |
| `registries-insecure` | array | List of insecure registries with their FQDN | \[\] |
| `registries-search` | array | List of registries to search short name images | \["registry.redhat.io", "quay.io"\] |
| `builder-image` | string | Location of the builder image that is used during the build | NA |
| `storage-driver` | string | Storage drivers that are used by `source-to-image`, such as overlay or vfs | "vfs" |
