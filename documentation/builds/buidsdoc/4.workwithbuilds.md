**Abstract**

This document provides procedural examples for using Builds.


* * *

## Chapter 1. Running Builds

After installing Builds, you can create a `buildah` or `source-to-image` build for use. You can also delete custom resources that are not required for a build.


### 1.1. Creating a buildah build

You can create a `buildah` build and push the created image to the target registry.


**Prerequisites**

- You have installed the Builds for Red Hat OpenShift Operator on the OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

- You have installed the `oc` CLI.

- Optional: You have installed the [`shp` CLI](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads).


**Procedure**

1. Create a `Build` resource and apply it to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster by using one of the CLIs:




**Example: Using `oc` CLI**

```
oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: Build
metadata:
     name: buildah-golang-build
spec:
     source:
       type: Git
       git:
         url: https://github.com/shipwright-io/sample-go
       contextDir: docker-build
     strategy:
       name: buildah
       kind: ClusterBuildStrategy
     paramValues:
  - name: dockerfile
    value: Dockerfile
output:
    image: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/buildah-example/sample-go-app
EOF
```

```shell-session
$ oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: Build
metadata:
name: buildah-golang-build
spec:
source:
```

[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/builds_for_red_hat_openshift/1.4/html-single/work_with_builds/index#CO2-1)

The location where the source code is placed.


[2](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/builds_for_red_hat_openshift/1.4/html-single/work_with_builds/index#CO2-2)

The build strategy that you use to build the container.


[3](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/builds_for_red_hat_openshift/1.4/html-single/work_with_builds/index#CO2-3)

The parameter defined in the build strategy. To set the value of the `dockerfile` strategy parameter, specify the Dockerfile location required to build the output image.


[4](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/builds_for_red_hat_openshift/1.4/html-single/work_with_builds/index#CO2-4)

The location where the built image is pushed. In this procedural example, the built image is pushed to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster internal registry. `buildah-example` is the name of the current project. Ensure that the specified project exists to allow the image push.


2. Check if the `Build` resource is created by using one of the CLIs:




**Example: Using `oc` CLI**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc get builds.shipwright.io buildah-golang-build
```



```shell-session
$ oc get builds.shipwright.io buildah-golang-build
```









**Example: Using `shp` CLI**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
shp build list
```



```shell-session
$ shp build list
```

3. Create a `BuildRun` resource and apply it to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster by using one of the CLIs:




**Example: Using `oc` CLI**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: BuildRun
metadata:
     name: buildah-golang-buildrun
spec:
     build:
       name: buildah-golang-build
EOF
```



```shell-session
$ oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: BuildRun
metadata:
     name: buildah-golang-buildrun
spec:
     build:
       name: buildah-golang-build
```

1

```shell-session

EOF
```







[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/builds_for_red_hat_openshift/1.4/html-single/work_with_builds/index#CO3-1)


The `spec.build.name` field denotes the respective build to run, which is expected to be available in the same namespace.






**Example: Using `shp` CLI**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
shp build run buildah-golang-build --follow
```



```shell-session
$ shp build run buildah-golang-build --follow
```

1

```shell-session

```







[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/builds_for_red_hat_openshift/1.4/html-single/work_with_builds/index#CO4-1)


Optional: By using the `--follow` flag, you can view the build logs in the output result.


4. Check if the `BuildRun` resource is created by running one of the following commands:




**Example: Using `oc` CLI**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc get buildrun buildah-golang-buildrun
```



```shell-session
$ oc get buildrun buildah-golang-buildrun
```









**Example: Using `shp` CLI**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
shp buildrun list
```



```shell-session
$ shp buildrun list
```








    The `BuildRun` resource creates a `TaskRun` resource, which then creates the pods to execute build strategy steps.



**Verification**

1. After all the containers complete their tasks, verify the following:




- Check whether the pod shows the `STATUS` field as `Completed`:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc get pods -w
```



```shell-session
$ oc get pods -w
```




**Example output**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
buildah-golang-buildrun-dtrg2-pod   2/2     Running   0          4s
buildah-golang-buildrun-dtrg2-pod   1/2     NotReady  0          7s
buildah-golang-buildrun-dtrg2-pod   0/2     Completed 0          55s
```



```shell-session
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
buildah-golang-buildrun-dtrg2-pod   2/2     Running   0          4s
buildah-golang-buildrun-dtrg2-pod   1/2     NotReady  0          7s
buildah-golang-buildrun-dtrg2-pod   0/2     Completed 0          55s
```

- Check whether the respective `TaskRun` resource shows the `SUCCEEDED` field as `True`:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc get tr
```



```shell-session
$ oc get tr
```




**Example output**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
NAME                           SUCCEEDED  REASON     STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
buildah-golang-buildrun-dtrg2  True       Succeeded  11m         8m51s
```



```shell-session
NAME                           SUCCEEDED  REASON     STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
buildah-golang-buildrun-dtrg2  True       Succeeded  11m         8m51s
```

- Check whether the respective `BuildRun` resource shows the `SUCCEEDED` field as `True`:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc get br
```



```shell-session
$ oc get br
```




**Example output**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
NAME                     SUCCEEDED   REASON       STARTTIME     COMPLETIONTIME
buildah-golang-buildrun  True        Succeeded    13m           11m
```



```shell-session
NAME                     SUCCEEDED   REASON       STARTTIME     COMPLETIONTIME
buildah-golang-buildrun  True        Succeeded    13m           11m
```








During verification, if a build run fails, you can check the `status.failureDetails` field in your `BuildRun` resource to identify the exact point where the failure happened in the pod or container.



Note






The pod might switch to a `NotReady` state because one of the containers has completed its task. This is an expected behavior.



2. Validate whether the image has been pushed to the registry that is specified in the `build.spec.output.image` field. You can try to pull the image by running the following command from a node that can access the internal registry:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
podman pull image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/<project>/<image>
```



```shell-session
$ podman pull image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/<project>/<image>
```

1

```shell-session

```


[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/builds_for_red_hat_openshift/1.4/html-single/work_with_builds/index#CO5-1)


The project name and image name used when creating the `Build` resource. For example, you can use `buildah-example` as the project name and `sample-go-app` as the image name.



#### 1.1.1. Creating buildah build in a network-restricted environment

You can create a `buildah` build in a network-restricted environment by mirroring the images required by the `buildah` build strategy.


**Prerequisites**

- Your cluster can connect and interact with the git source that you can use to create the buildah build.


**Procedure**

1. Run the following command to mirror the images required by the `buildah` build strategy:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc image mirror --insecure -a <registry_authentication> registry.redhat.io/ubi8/buildah@sha256:1c89cc3cab0ac0fc7387c1fe5e63443468219aab6fd531c8dad6d22fd999819e <mirror_registry>/<repo>/ubi8_buildah
```



```shell-session
$ oc image mirror --insecure -a <registry_authentication> registry.redhat.io/ubi8/buildah@sha256:1c89cc3cab0ac0fc7387c1fe5e63443468219aab6fd531c8dad6d22fd999819e <mirror_registry>/<repo>/ubi8_buildah
```

2. Perform the steps mentioned in the "Creating a buildah build" section.


### 1.2. Creating a source-to-image build

You can create a `source-to-image` build and push the created image to a custom Quay repository.


**Prerequisites**

- You have installed the Builds for Red Hat OpenShift Operator on the OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

- You have installed the `oc` CLI.

- Optional: You have installed the [`shp` CLI](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads).


**Procedure**

1. Create a `Build` resource and apply it to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster by using one of the CLIs:




**Example: Using `oc` CLI**

s2i-nodejs-buildrun      True        Succeeded    2m41s           15s
```








During verification, if a build run fails, you can check the `status.failureDetails` field in your `BuildRun` resource to identify the exact point where the failure happened in the pod or container.



Note






The pod might switch to a `NotReady` state because one of the containers has completed its task. This is an expected behavior.



2. Validate whether the image has been pushed to the registry that is specified in the `build.spec.output.image` field. You can try to pull the image by running the following command after logging in to the registry:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
podman pull quay.io/<repo>/<image>

You can create a `source-to-image` build in a network-restricted environment by mirroring the images required by the `source-to-image` build strategy.


**Prerequisites**

- Your cluster can connect and interact with the git source that you can use to create the source-to-image build.

- You have the builder-image required to create the `source-to-image` build in your local registry. If you do not have the builder-image in the local registry, mirror the source image.


**Procedure**

1. Run the following command to mirror the images required by the `source-to-image` build strategy:

```
oc image mirror --insecure -a <registry_authentication> registry.redhat.io/source-to-image/source-to-image-rhel8@sha256:d041c1bbe503d152d0759598f79802e257816d674b342670ef61c6f9e6d401c5 <mirror_registry>/<repo>/source-to-image-source-to-image-rhel8
```



```shell-session
$ oc image mirror --insecure -a <registry_authentication> registry.redhat.io/source-to-image/source-to-image-rhel8@sha256:d041c1bbe503d152d0759598f79802e257816d674b342670ef61c6f9e6d401c5 <mirror_registry>/<repo>/source-to-image-source-to-image-rhel8
```

2. Perform the steps mentioned in the "Creating a source-to-image build" section.


### 1.3. Viewing logs

You can view the logs of a build run to identify any runtime errors and to resolve them.


**Prerequisites**

- You have installed the `oc` CLI.

- Optional: You have installed the `shp` CLI.


**Procedure**

- View logs of a build run by using one of the CLIs:




**Using `oc` CLI**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc logs <buildrun_resource_name>
```



```shell-session
$ oc logs <buildrun_resource_name>
```









**Using `shp` CLI**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
shp buildrun logs <buildrun_resource_name>
```



```shell-session
$ shp buildrun logs <buildrun_resource_name>
```


### 1.4. Deleting a resource

You can delete a `Build`, `BuildRun`, or `BuildStrategy` resource if it is not required in your project.


**Prerequisites**

- You have installed the `oc` CLI.

- Optional: You have installed the `shp` CLI.


**Procedure**

- Delete a `Build` resource by using one of the CLIs:




**Using `oc` CLI**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc delete builds.shipwright.io <build_resource_name>
```



```shell-session
$ oc delete builds.shipwright.io <build_resource_name>
```









**Using `shp` CLI**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
shp build delete <build_resource_name>
```



```shell-session
$ shp build delete <build_resource_name>
```

- Delete a `BuildRun` resource by using one of the CLIs:




**Using `oc` CLI**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc delete buildrun <buildrun_resource_name>
```



```shell-session
$ oc delete buildrun <buildrun_resource_name>
```









**Using `shp` CLI**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
shp buildrun delete <buildrun_resource_name>
```



```shell-session
$ shp buildrun delete <buildrun_resource_name>
```

- Delete a `BuildStrategy` resource by running the following command:




**Using `oc` CLI**





Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc delete buildstrategies <buildstartegy_resource_name>
```



```shell-session
$ oc delete buildstrategies <buildstartegy_resource_name>
```
