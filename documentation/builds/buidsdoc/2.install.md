**Abstract**

This document provides information about installing Builds.


* * *

## Chapter 1. Installing Builds

As a cluster administrator, you can install Builds on an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.


### 1.1. Prerequisites

- You have access to the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

- You have installed the `oc` CLI.

- You are logged in to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster as an administrator.

- Your cluster has the [Marketplace capability](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/installing/overview/cluster-capabilities.html#marketplace-operator_cluster-capabilities) enabled or the Red Hat Operator catalog source configured manually.


Note

As a dependency component, the Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines Operator is automatically installed along with the Builds for Red Hat OpenShift Operator during installation. If you have already installed the Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines Operator, Builds uses that Operator for its functioning.


### 1.2. Installing Builds by using the web console

You can install the Builds for Red Hat OpenShift Operator from the OperatorHub by using the builds for Red Hat OpenShift web console. Installing this Operator enables you to install and use build components.


**Procedure**

1. In the **Administrator** perspective of the web console, navigate to the **Operators** → **OperatorHub** page.

2. Use the **Filter by keyword** box to search for Builds for Red Hat OpenShift Operator in the catalog.

3. Click the **Builds for Red Hat OpenShift Operator** tile.

4. Read the brief description about the Operator and click **Install**.

5. On the **Install Operator** page:




1. Check that the **Installation Mode** is set to **All namespaces on the cluster (default)**. This mode installs the Operator in the default `openshift-builds` namespace to watch and be made available to all namespaces in the cluster.

2. Check that the **Installed Namespace** is set to `openshift-builds` by default.

3. Select **Automatic** for the **Approval Strategy**. This ensures that the future upgrades to the Operator are handled automatically by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). If you select the **Manual** approval strategy, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve the OLM update request to update the Operator to the new version.

4. Select an **Update Channel**:




- The **Update Channel** is set to **latest** by default. The latest channel enables installation of the most recent stable version of the Builds for Red Hat OpenShift Operator.

- To install a specific version of the Builds for Red Hat OpenShift Operator, cluster administrators can use the corresponding `builds-<version>` channel. For example, to install the Builds for Red Hat OpenShift Operator version `1.3`, you can use the `builds-1.3` channel.


6. Click **Install**.


**Verification**

After installing the Builds for Red Hat OpenShift Operator, you must verify that the required resources are created to ensure proper functioning of the controllers.


**Procedure**

1. In the **Administrator** perspective of the web console, select the project as openshift-builds.

2. Navigate to the **Operators** → **Installed Operators** page.

3. Click the **All instances** tab.

4. On the **All instances** tab, verify that the `OpenShiftBuild` and `ShipwrightBuild` instances are listed.

5. Now, navigate to the **Workloads** → **Pods** page.

6. On the **Pods** page, verify that the following pods are listed:




- The `openshift-builds` operator pod

- Build controller and build webhook pods

- `SharedResource` daemonset and `SharedResource` webhook pods


### 1.3. Installing Builds by using the CLI

You can also install Builds by using the command-line interface (CLI).


**Procedure**

1. Create a `sub.yaml` subscription object file to subscribe a namespace to the Builds for Red Hat OpenShift Operator, as shown in the following example:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
     name: openshift-builds-operator
     namespace: openshift-builds
spec:
     channel: <channel-name>
     name: openshift-builds-operator
     source: redhat-operators
     sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
```



```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
     name: openshift-builds-operator
     namespace: openshift-builds
spec:
     channel: <channel-name>
```

1

```yaml

     name: openshift-builds-operator
```

2

```yaml

     source: redhat-operators
```

3

```yaml

     sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
```

4

```yaml

```


[1](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/builds_for_red_hat_openshift/1.4/html-single/install/index#CO1-1)


The channel name from where you want to subscribe the Operator.


[2](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/builds_for_red_hat_openshift/1.4/html-single/install/index#CO1-2)


Name of the Operator to subscribe to.


[3](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/builds_for_red_hat_openshift/1.4/html-single/install/index#CO1-3)


Name of the CatalogSource that provides the Operator.


[4](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/builds_for_red_hat_openshift/1.4/html-single/install/index#CO1-4)


Namespace of the CatalogSource. Use `openshift-marketplace` for the default OperatorHub CatalogSources.


2. Apply the subscription object by runninng the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc apply -f sub.yml
```



```shell-session
$ oc apply -f sub.yml
```



    The Builds for Red Hat OpenShift Operator is now installed in the default target namespace `openshift-builds`.



**Verification**

After installing the Builds for Red Hat OpenShift Operator, you must verify that the following resources are created to ensure proper functioning of the Operator:


1. Run the following command to ensure that the `OpenshiftBuild` resource is created:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc get openshiftbuilds
```



```shell-session
$ oc get openshiftbuilds
```

2. Run the following command to ensure that the `ShipwrightBuilds` resource is created:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc get shipwrightbuilds
```



```shell-session
$ oc get shipwrightbuilds
```

3. Run the following command to ensure that the following pods are created in the `openshift-builds` namespace:




- `openshift-builds` operator pod

- Build controller and build webhook pods

- SharedResource daemonset and SharedResource webhook pods

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc get pods -n openshift-builds
```



```shell-session
$ oc get pods -n openshift-builds
```



The list of pods is displayed as shown in the following example:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc get pods -n openshift-builds
```



```shell-session
$ oc get pods -n openshift-builds

```


### 1.4. Disabling ShipwrightBuilds build controller and webhook pod

You can disable the `ShipwrightBuilds` Custom Resource (CR) without disabling the shared-resources Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver component and the `ShipwrightBuilds` Custom Resource Definition (CRD). Disabling the `ShipwrightBuilds` CR removes the `ShipwrightBuilds` build controller and `ShipwrightBuilds` build webhook pod from the `openshift-builds` namespace.


**Procedure**

- Disable the `ShipwrightBuilds` controller and webhook by running the following command:

Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

```
oc patch openshiftbuild cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"shipwright":{"build":{"state":"Disabled"}}}}'
```



```shell-session
$ oc patch openshiftbuild cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"shipwright":{"build":{"state":"Disabled"}}}}'
```



This command disables the build controller and webhook but does not affect the `ShipwrightBuilds` CRD.
