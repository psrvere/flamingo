**Abstract**

This document provides information about build controller observability.

## Chapter 1. Build controller observability

Builds exposes several metrics to help you monitor the performance and functioning of your build resources. The build controller metrics are exposed on the port `8383`.


### 1.1. Build controller metrics

You can check the following build controller metrics for monitoring purposes:


| Name | Type | Description | Labels | Status |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `build_builds_registered_total` | Counter | The number of total registered builds. | - `buildstrategy=<build_buildstrategy_name>`<br>- `namespace=<buildrun_namespace>`<br>- `build=<build_name>` | experimental |
| `build_buildruns_completed_total` | Counter | The number of total completed build runs. | - `buildstrategy=<build_buildstrategy_name>`<br>- `namespace=<buildrun_namespace>`<br>- `build=<build_name>`<br>- `buildrun=<buildrun_name>` | experimental |
| `build_buildrun_establish_duration_seconds` | Histogram | The build run establish duration in seconds. | - `buildstrategy=<build_buildstrategy_name>`<br>- `namespace=<buildrun_namespace>`<br>- `build=<build_name>`<br>- `buildrun=<buildrun_name>` | experimental |
| `build_buildrun_completion_duration_seconds` | Histogram | The build run completion duration in seconds. | - `buildstrategy=<build_buildstrategy_name>`<br>- `namespace=<buildrun_namespace>`<br>- `build=<build_name>`<br>- `buildrun=<buildrun_name>` | experimental |
| `build_buildrun_rampup_duration_seconds` | Histogram | The build run ramp-up duration in seconds. | - `buildstrategy=<build_buildstrategy_name>`<br>- `namespace=<buildrun_namespace>`<br>- `build=<build_name>`<br>- `buildrun=<buildrun_name>` | experimental |
| `build_buildrun_taskrun_rampup_duration_seconds` | Histogram | The build run ramp-up duration for a task run in seconds. | - `buildstrategy=<build_buildstrategy_name>`<br>- `namespace=<buildrun_namespace>`<br>- `build=<build_name>`<br>- `buildrun=<buildrun_name>` | experimental |
| `build_buildrun_taskrun_pod_rampup_duration_seconds` | Histogram | The build run ramp-up duration for a task run pod in seconds. | - `buildstrategy=<build_buildstrategy_name>`<br>- `namespace=<buildrun_namespace>`<br>- `build=<build_name>`<br>- `buildrun=<buildrun_name>` | experimental |

Table 1.1. Build controller metrics

#### 1.1.1. Histogram metrics

To use custom buckets for the build controller, you must set the environment variable for a particular histogram metric. The following table shows the environment variables for all histogram metrics:


| Metric | Environment variable | Default |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `build_buildrun_establish_duration_seconds` | `PROMETHEUS_BR_EST_DUR_BUCKETS` | `0,1,2,3,5,7,10,15,20,30` |
| `build_buildrun_completion_duration_seconds` | `PROMETHEUS_BR_COMP_DUR_BUCKETS` | `50,100,150,200,250,300,350,400,450,500` |
| `build_buildrun_rampup_duration_seconds` | `PROMETHEUS_BR_RAMPUP_DUR_BUCKETS` | `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10` |
| `build_buildrun_taskrun_rampup_duration_seconds` | `PROMETHEUS_BR_RAMPUP_DUR_BUCKETS` | `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10` |
| `build_buildrun_taskrun_pod_rampup_duration_seconds` | `PROMETHEUS_BR_RAMPUP_DUR_BUCKETS` | `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10` |
